17,Mon Oct 19 22:46:42 +0000 2020,"@LafLib @LafColCovid @LafCol This doesn’t address what some professors expect students to do. Many professors still expect students to print articles, labs, more."

19,Mon Oct 19 21:36:25 +0000 2020,Hey @LafCol profs: some students without their own printers are flummoxed about how to print out assignments or labs. Gotta phase ten out! @LafLib is there a way to arrange printing and then contactless pickup at the lib? #lafcolcovid #WearAMask #stopweekendpartying
20,Sat Oct 17 18:50:50 +0000 2020,"@LafCol since you aren't posting COVID case numbers on contemporary communication media for the public, we'll help. 7 new cases today on top of already slowly climbing case numbers. If u r a parent who sent your kid to us, they need to be extra careful right now. #lafcol"
