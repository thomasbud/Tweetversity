15,Thu Oct 22 16:53:39 +0000 2020,@AlexaKaye3 2- I believe that @UToledo can capitalize by putting more videos of advartising on YouTube. They could make it so these ads pop up for Ohio residents and Monroe county residents to gain students. #ICMKTG #UToledoMarketing

All @BYU can do is control its own destiny by winning out, which is exactly what #BYUFootball did in 1984."

I'm just keeping my @BYUfootball-heart held in check just a little bit.

But to be clear, they look REALLY, REALLY good.

So although I'm not drinking the @koolaid yet, I might be sneaking a snort or two of #koolaid powder from time to time."
