Speaking to prospective students about my memorable experiences at MC and how outstanding the education department is. If you’re thinking of going to MC, 10/10 would recommend! #ProudAlumni"

5,Thu Oct 22 16:52:13 +0000 2020,@karaieva24 @Ianplevy @RowanCED @ManhattanEdu Powerful!
6,Wed Oct 21 23:31:17 +0000 2020,@karaieva24 @Ianplevy @RowanCED @ManhattanEdu Dang! I would have loved to sit in on this conversation.
7,Wed Oct 21 19:41:31 +0000 2020,@mirandayaver @ManhattanEdu @ESS_of_ISA One of my students pointed it out! I'm thrilled.
8,Wed Oct 21 19:41:04 +0000 2020,@paminnyc @ManhattanEdu @ESS_of_ISA Oh wow! That's a fantastic ratio! (A lot better than what I typically accomplish on my syllabi.)
9,Wed Oct 21 19:40:10 +0000 2020,"I just realized that in my #environmental #politics class, there are 20 readings (chapters/articles) by female authors and 14 by male (including pieces co-authored by male/female which are counted in each column). Hooray! #AcademicTwitter @ManhattanEdu @ESS_of_ISA @mirandayaver"
10,Wed Oct 21 17:11:40 +0000 2020,"Will this be enough to get @ManhattanEdu to take down the celebratory portrait of Rudy Giuliani hanging in the library? Doubtful, but a girl can dream."
11,Wed Oct 21 12:30:45 +0000 2020,@ManhattanEdu Hey @ManhattanEdu: Why are you still using the image of a student reported to your administration for racist social media posts in promotional materials? I thought MC supports #BlackLivesMatter ?
12,Wed Oct 21 06:32:32 +0000 2020,"@sandrahpark @JulieLeiningerP @ManhattanEdu I don't think so. I came to know about her rather much later. She's 장정온 and probably kidnapped by the NK authority during the war, right? Perhaps due to her oldest brother's high-profile political presence?"
13,Wed Oct 21 00:49:06 +0000 2020,"@Mark1994usa @ManhattanEdu @Manhattan_WBB Completely false. It’s a fact that Black Lives do Matter &amp; they want America to improve, not ignore the issues at hand.

This makes me a proud Jasper Alumnus and will happily make more donations. I’ll take over while you stay mad about human compassion."
14,Tue Oct 20 15:51:29 +0000 2020,"@Juman_Kim @JulieLeiningerP @ManhattanEdu Very interesting. Did they ever mention Agneta Chang (aunt, Maryknoll sister last seen in NK during the war)?"
15,Tue Oct 20 15:35:23 +0000 2020,@ManhattanEdu @Manhattan_WBB BLM is an anti-American organization. Please don’t ask me to make a gift when you engage with causes that want to fundamentally transform this nation all because of a false narrative. Thanks.

17,Tue Oct 20 03:50:15 +0000 2020,"@sandrahpark @JulieLeiningerP @ManhattanEdu One of my philosophy professors back in college was Chang Myon's nephew. The prominent Catholic family that produced some scholars, members of the clergy, and politicians of distinguished talent!"
18,Tue Oct 20 02:28:05 +0000 2020,"@JulieLeiningerP @ManhattanEdu Yes. The Chang family will certainly come up, especially Mary Agneta Chang."
19,Mon Oct 19 18:51:53 +0000 2020,"@ManhattanEdu For those who are remote, the event will be broadcast through our Instagram Live via @manhattanwbb 

Thank you!"

All the rest of us got barred from attending.. it was not public as stated. according to the tweets I read you had to sign in with your college e-mail.
32,Sun Oct 18 02:48:58 +0000 2020,So heartbroken right now.. was exited for several days to be able to see @brian_littrell and @littrell_baylee just to have my heart ripped out from the people at @ManhattanEdu changing the situation a few hours beforehand and not allowing the rest of us to join. 😭 #BSB #lecture
33,Sun Oct 18 00:07:30 +0000 2020,@ManhattanEdu @brian_littrell @littrell_baylee They better get @brian_littrell &amp; @littrell_baylee back and do it right for all of us and not change it a couple hours before starting! 🤨
