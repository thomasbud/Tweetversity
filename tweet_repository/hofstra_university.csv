9,Fri Oct 23 14:56:49 +0000 2020,"@benrifkin @RussophilesU @HofstraU probably minus the film is that the story is from the Thief. And if the director does not idealize him, he wants to evoke sympathy. but the boy and his windy mother are doomed to hardships and deprivation with or without a thief."
