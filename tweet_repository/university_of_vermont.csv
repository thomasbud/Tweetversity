12,Sat Oct 24 16:17:25 +0000 2020,I've been interviewing @uvmvermont Film &amp; TV studies colleagues for my Classical Cinema course to help students connect with faculty at a time when they aren't having organic interactions. The benefit of this is that I also get to have inspiring conversations with my colleagues.
