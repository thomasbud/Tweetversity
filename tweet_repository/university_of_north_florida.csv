1,Mon Oct 26 13:13:14 +0000 2020,"@cspanwj @mbpolisci @AGAshleyMoody FL is a Two Party Consent state.  You just seemed to confess to ""recording"" and ""reviewing"" the reactions of Florida residents phone calls with @UNFPORL.  @UofNorthFlorida should investigate to clarify the legality of your polling process."

5,Fri Oct 23 17:36:15 +0000 2020,@ErinWestgate @UofNorthFlorida Probably just a lot more honest and self-aware! Iâ€™d guess that a lot of people underestimate their answers on that calculator.
6,Wed Oct 21 19:26:34 +0000 2020,@FLBOG @UofNorthFlorida Allow 2020 graduates to have real ceremonies.  You can't keep putting them off forever.  Why is football allowed but not ceremonies?  We want to graduate.  Why not allow Universities to utilize football stadiums for this very purpose.  I will post this every day until you respond
