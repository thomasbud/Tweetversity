11,Wed Oct 21 22:08:13 +0000 2020,@susanthe How is @UofNH tolerating this? It's damaging their brand and I'm skeptical of their judgement in keeping him. #nhpolitics

16,Wed Oct 21 01:00:23 +0000 2020,@ChrisPappasNH @UofNH Hopefully just those who are New Hampshire residents
17,Wed Oct 21 00:38:26 +0000 2020,"@ChrisPappasNH @UofNH Simple question just popped into my head:

Is UNH collecting OUT-OF-STATE tuition from any of these students they're helping to vote here in NH?"
18,Tue Oct 20 23:01:54 +0000 2020,Why hasn't the @UofNH Covid dashboard been updated for today? @UNHPrez?

HN = Home Now!"

much better than accidentally exp...you know, never mind."
24,Mon Oct 19 19:30:23 +0000 2020,@lexlanham @UofNH Timely.
25,Mon Oct 19 19:25:43 +0000 2020,@lexlanham @UofNH I have to wonder what the gender splits are for those who have camera blocks like that on their laptop and those who don‚Äôt. Bet it‚Äôs way more women.
26,Mon Oct 19 19:18:35 +0000 2020,@lexlanham @UofNH Yes! These are so necessary

I went to my home state school (@UMassAmherst) for my BA and MA, then @NUPoliSci for my PhD, and now happily work at another state school (@UofSC). Hope to see my own kids there in a couple years."
32,Sun Oct 18 02:19:20 +0000 2020,"@dannagal @BrendanNyhan @JoshCompton2011 @UofNH @Penn @AnnenbergPenn @UDelaware so if you're confident you would be elite institution material, save the effort and apply to state school! 

(IIRC research used NYS records, so both the cheapest state systems in the country and a wide range of elite privates)"
33,Sun Oct 18 01:50:22 +0000 2020,@scottlgreer @BrendanNyhan @JoshCompton2011 @UofNH @Penn @AnnenbergPenn @UDelaware Wow I had NOT heard that just where you apply is as good of a predictor as actually going. So agency and internal motivation matter.
34,Sun Oct 18 01:47:33 +0000 2020,"@dannagal @BrendanNyhan @JoshCompton2011 @UofNH @Penn @AnnenbergPenn @UDelaware Same. Put aside my bio (go UW-Milwaukee, great education in life and letters); I am minded of research that suggests applications, not admissions, predict; applying to Dartmouth (UM, etc) predicts outcomes as well as getting in. More darkly, suggests the sorting happens earlier."

The house had shutters when we lived there, &amp; has a new sign on the barn, but otherwise the exterior is unchanged. My dad had the ‚òÄÔ∏èpanels installed in ‚Äò77, right after we moved in!"
