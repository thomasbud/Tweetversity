115,Mon Oct 19 14:56:32 +0000 2020,@dawnalde @UofOklahoma she is out of the hospital and the baby is okay as far as everything else it‚Äôs her life and her story so i won‚Äôt comment about it thank you for the retweet though..
116,Mon Oct 19 14:05:13 +0000 2020,"@wxjay @UofOklahoma Right, medical is up there, though booklet is seriously repetitive about networks and light on info re coverage; I wouldn‚Äôt let my sophomores get away with prose like that. Dental doesn‚Äôt discuss basics, and vision nothing."
117,Mon Oct 19 13:53:40 +0000 2020,"@chemdocmommy @UofOklahoma Medical benefits booklet is up on the Benefits enrollment page with the breakdowns by procedure.

Dental coverage information is in a video on the Benefits Virtual Fair site. 

No idea about vision."
118,Mon Oct 19 03:18:59 +0000 2020,"@profamymcgovern @UofOklahoma Yes, though co-insurance is lower for medical. I've had very few expenses this year as some things I was planning to do have been postponed due to pandemic."
119,Mon Oct 19 03:10:59 +0000 2020,@chemdocmommy @UofOklahoma Did you see how much our maximum out of pocket is going up this year?? Absolutely ridiculous!!
120,Mon Oct 19 03:09:45 +0000 2020,@chemdocmommy @UofOklahoma We‚Äôre supposed to just accept it gratefully and assume that it is good. I‚Äôve had so many people tell me it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù. They should try living somewhere else. We had actually good insurance in Massachusetts. And that was even pre ACA! I‚Äôm sure it is excellent now.
121,Mon Oct 19 01:55:53 +0000 2020,@kimwolf @CynthiaMTeague @UofOklahoma @MetLife I've had discontinuous care &amp; had to find other providers when there were issues getting approvals in the past. Mainly I'm just annoyed at the lack of information.
122,Mon Oct 19 01:27:38 +0000 2020,@chemdocmommy @CynthiaMTeague @UofOklahoma @MetLife Most of them will start accepting whatever OU selects.
123,Mon Oct 19 01:25:35 +0000 2020,@CynthiaMTeague @kimwolf @UofOklahoma @MetLife Yeah - 23 within 10 miles of 73071. I don't know if it uses from center of zip code or edge. Most of those 7 were 73069 üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
124,Mon Oct 19 01:21:49 +0000 2020,"@CynthiaMTeague @kimwolf @UofOklahoma @MetLife Oh - and 7 providers within 5 miles of 73071 (so roughly in main Norman city limits). Since this is an employee paid benefit (no OU contribution), I am baffled."
125,Mon Oct 19 01:07:10 +0000 2020,"@kimwolf @chemdocmommy @UofOklahoma And so much extra work for providers, too."
126,Mon Oct 19 00:55:22 +0000 2020,RT @chemdocmommy: New insurance companies for 2021 - new dental and vision providers. Not a shred of information provided at the HR site ab‚Ä¶
127,Mon Oct 19 00:50:19 +0000 2020,@chemdocmommy @CynthiaMTeague @UofOklahoma I‚Äôve never understood how frequent switching pays off. Seems inefficient and wasteful‚Äîcompanies are chasing contracts.
128,Mon Oct 19 00:35:20 +0000 2020,"@CynthiaMTeague @UofOklahoma Yep, I decided to stop screaming at my computer and scream into the Twitter void. Also the benefits enrollment &amp; fair websites have several broken or missing links. Some things only linked on ""fair""."
