2,Sun Oct 25 21:20:37 +0000 2020,@morgan_philbin @CandaceWinstea1 @omarsrashad @CalPoly Also curious: we are inexplicably conducting fewer tests now than we were during Week 4 of the quarter.
3,Sun Oct 25 20:20:18 +0000 2020,"@bridgebot @morgan_philbin @omarsrashad @CalPoly Ugh.... right. It‚Äôs just hard to know! You‚Äôd think they could hire a senior project stats person to work w de identified data. Not that hard, and important to get right."
4,Sun Oct 25 20:18:45 +0000 2020,@bridgebot @CandaceWinstea1 @omarsrashad @CalPoly I was trying to figure out general positivity rates to guess if they might be included but gave up. Given how many good/accurate examples of dashboards there are at other universities Im continually amazed at how terrible Cal Poly‚Äôs is...
5,Sun Oct 25 20:17:47 +0000 2020,"@CandaceWinstea1 @morgan_philbin @omarsrashad @CalPoly Isolation #'s aren't a reliable guide, tho. We've had 40+ on-campus cases this fall, but only 16 listed in isolation &amp; 16 as recovered (since 9/3). Did others move home or off-campus? The positive/isolation/recovered #'s make no sense the past 2 weeks."
6,Sun Oct 25 20:02:44 +0000 2020,"@morgan_philbin @CandaceWinstea1 @omarsrashad @CalPoly The dashboard positives may well include the Ongoing Testing results, but no one's confirmed this and the dashboard explanation is very strangely worded."
7,Sun Oct 25 19:49:08 +0000 2020,@omarsrashad @CalPoly 100%. It‚Äôs so clear that they‚Äôre lying about data and care more about covering their own mishandling of the pandemic than the lives of @CountyofSLO residents.  If you ever wondered what @CalPoly prioritizes they have made it very clear
8,Sun Oct 25 19:47:01 +0000 2020,@CandaceWinstea1 @omarsrashad @CalPoly That is incredibly unethical. Not only (as you noted) does it have epidemiological implications but it is also a breach of trust. Why should students change their behavior and respond to university requests if @CalPoly doesn‚Äôt care enough to be honest about student safety??
9,Sun Oct 25 17:30:55 +0000 2020,"@morgan_philbin @omarsrashad @CalPoly Also, you can tell if on campus positive is from ‚Äúongoing testing‚Äù if the on campus isolation # goes up, but no new CHW cases in last 24 hr. Off campus we are completely in the dark. An informed community is safer, can make better future plans etc."
10,Sun Oct 25 17:29:15 +0000 2020,@morgan_philbin @CalPoly Yeah that's definitely not clear here at all
11,Sun Oct 25 17:25:41 +0000 2020,"@morgan_philbin @omarsrashad @CalPoly They have chosen not to report. Here‚Äôs the thing about that-(which you know) Our response to this pandemic will be ongoing for *years*, so posting these data will tell us where we are *now* &amp; help us plan future. The #, % pos cannot be that high-so why the obfuscation??"
12,Sun Oct 25 17:01:15 +0000 2020,@omarsrashad Where is @CalPoly reporting the results from its ‚Äúongoing testing‚Äù?? I can‚Äôt find them anywhere
13,Sat Oct 24 19:15:31 +0000 2020,"@bridgebot @CalPoly I know off-campus tests associated w/ CP students are tracked and can be reported to CP, they were reported prior to Sept. This honestly looks like covering up the true number of cases of CP-associated people in the community.  Why would they want this appearance?"
14,Sat Oct 24 11:08:27 +0000 2020,@bridgebot @CalPoly @SLOPublicHealth And what about the results from the ‚Äúmass‚Äù testing they‚Äôre doing? I can‚Äôt find those anywhere. It‚Äôs pretty amazing how terrible their dashboard is...
15,Sat Oct 24 03:11:32 +0000 2020,"RT @bridgebot: Were any of today's grim record-breaking coronavirus cases Cal Poly students? We don't know, because @calpoly didn't bother‚Ä¶"
16,Sat Oct 24 03:01:36 +0000 2020,"Were any of today's grim record-breaking coronavirus cases Cal Poly students? We don't know, because @calpoly didn't bother to update its dashboard today. Did they withhold results from @SLOPublicHealth, or just those of us in the Cal Poly community?"
17,Thu Oct 22 22:09:38 +0000 2020,"@nolahtheveil Yeah, @CalPoly lost a real one. While the Chair (a WW), still encouraged me to apply for an open-tenure position (as I was quitting w/ a laundry list of discriminatory crap-L O L). The problem really stems from the community and is cultivated in the university. IMO"
18,Thu Oct 22 17:47:21 +0000 2020,@CalPoly The sky is covered in clouds rn...
19,Thu Oct 22 17:45:31 +0000 2020,@ZL1nK @CalPoly Haha.  I was thinking the same thing!  Good that it's still there.

21,Thu Oct 22 05:08:01 +0000 2020,"@CPMustangNews I'm glad my son is home for the last 2 quarters &amp; likely a 3rd if this is the kind of things @CalPoly students support.

There is NEVER *any* excuse to protest on A FREEWAY, none whatsoever. The young privileged folks who do this that think it's some sort of RESOLUTION are wrong!"

23,Wed Oct 21 22:36:32 +0000 2020,@JWCarpenter1979 Great organization.  Planted the seed (pun intended) for my daughter to study Agriculture @CalPoly
24,Tue Oct 20 21:51:29 +0000 2020,"@IstamiNafisa I might have went away straight after high school (still undecided on this) and would have studied abroad.

But I enjoyed my time at a #Community College, then at @CalPoly!"
25,Tue Oct 20 15:09:29 +0000 2020,@CalPoly I love the Cal Poly Band
26,Mon Oct 19 16:51:35 +0000 2020,@jdstalnaked Me too but that was 15 years ago. Couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that now. Go @CalPoly Mustangs!
27,Mon Oct 19 11:51:35 +0000 2020,@Trav_sac @CalPoly @CPPrezArmstrong Oh yeah...and it's a quarterly fee.  They could've chose to reduce or remove some of these fees for just one quarter.  Look under the hood Lisa.  BTW...I love disagreeing with you.  It only happens 1% of the time!
28,Mon Oct 19 11:50:14 +0000 2020,"@Trav_sac @CalPoly @CPPrezArmstrong Student Success Fee $301
Associated Students Fee $116
University Union Fee $261
Health Services Fee $220
SIRF Fee $2

These fees should've been discounted during the SIP.  These fees should be reduced because the students aren't having access to the product being paid for."
29,Mon Oct 19 05:00:21 +0000 2020,"@bradledwith @CalPoly @CPPrezArmstrong Trying to get blocked again @bradledwith ? C‚Äômon. Cal Poly always does right by its students ... you know that! $3333 for high quality education, be it virtual or in person, is still the deal of the century."

He holds on of your MAs, but obviously doesn't think. Did he have someone take his tests like the Cheeto-in-chief did?"
