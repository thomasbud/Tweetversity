1,Mon Oct 26 19:09:45 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Good luck! You will make it. I pray for a suma cum laude for you, because I love your topic"
2,Mon Oct 26 19:04:28 +0000 2020,@markcubsfan @bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU At first I thought it said eccentric GENERATIONAL waves and thought it must be cool to research families with a group of odd aunties every few generations!
3,Mon Oct 26 18:04:01 +0000 2020,So I get tested every week by the school but my results from a past week still haven‚Äôt shown up by the time I‚Äôm ready for the current week‚Äôs test. How does that make sense @WestVirginiaU ?
4,Mon Oct 26 17:59:59 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU following! I'm fascinated but not very knowledgeable. Anxious to follow and learn.
5,Mon Oct 26 17:48:43 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Actually that‚Äôs #WVU88 for the grad year.  But still...
6,Mon Oct 26 17:47:45 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU That‚Äôs a great flag. Can a member of #WVU84 get one?  I can Venmo ya.
7,Mon Oct 26 16:41:50 +0000 2020,@TBL06656392 @WestVirginiaU I plan on defending next semester üò£ Still so much to do so we'll see ü§ûüèø
8,Mon Oct 26 16:40:07 +0000 2020,"@Garb0Garb0 @WestVirginiaU You're close! It's more like a ripple cuz these huge objects (i.e. black holes, neutron stars) are moving so fast through spacetime."

10,Mon Oct 26 16:32:20 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU I never got cool swag when I got into WVU :(

12,Mon Oct 26 16:30:42 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU I would apply but my grades are absolutely terrible right now üòî
13,Mon Oct 26 16:03:35 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Scrolled past this while listening to a podcast about gravity and space curvature, probably a sign to ask a question I had: is a gravitational wave a curve in space moving away from a massive object that created it? Im sure it‚Äôs more complicated but am I close at all?"
14,Mon Oct 26 15:34:44 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Go WVU Mountaineers!
15,Mon Oct 26 14:02:09 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Lovely..

21,Mon Oct 26 10:46:17 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Nice easy subject.  ü§î

23,Mon Oct 26 09:53:51 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Love this area of research.
24,Mon Oct 26 09:20:11 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Keep being awesome.  These gravitational wave graphics always show this plane.  I wonder now about the 90 degree or 45 degree plane and the relitaves strengths of waves in those planes.
25,Mon Oct 26 08:23:05 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU What do you mean by eccentric? Unusual in nature, or of unknown origin? Or both? Or what?"

27,Mon Oct 26 07:32:38 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Good luck with your doctorate!  That subject sounds fascinating. All still very science fictional when I was an Astronomy student in 1978.

2. Dropped passes. 7 of them. They add up."

They have the preseason Big 12 def. player of the year. Darius Stills. His brother plays right beside him. Their Dad was a WVU great and played 9 yrs in the NFL.
86,Sat Oct 24 17:47:23 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball @BillyGaither1 I was supportive back in the Blake bell days but the fan base makes them hard to like. And then just the type of team that the guys portrays themselves as. I remember WVU fans coming to our home games and they were great to get along with no matter what. I have a WVU hoodie lol
87,Sat Oct 24 17:44:16 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball I know right!! I‚Äôm hoping our offense will pull through! We had a slow start this year and definitely after our QB got hurt that put a kink in a few things. But luckily our redshirt QB was able to step up to the plate. I was watching WVU at the begining smash their first opponent
