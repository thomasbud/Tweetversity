1,Mon Oct 26 19:09:45 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Good luck! You will make it. I pray for a suma cum laude for you, because I love your topic"
2,Mon Oct 26 19:04:28 +0000 2020,@markcubsfan @bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU At first I thought it said eccentric GENERATIONAL waves and thought it must be cool to research families with a group of odd aunties every few generations!
3,Mon Oct 26 18:04:01 +0000 2020,So I get tested every week by the school but my results from a past week still haven’t shown up by the time I’m ready for the current week’s test. How does that make sense @WestVirginiaU ?
4,Mon Oct 26 17:59:59 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU following! I'm fascinated but not very knowledgeable. Anxious to follow and learn.
5,Mon Oct 26 17:48:43 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Actually that’s #WVU88 for the grad year.  But still...
6,Mon Oct 26 17:47:45 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU That’s a great flag. Can a member of #WVU84 get one?  I can Venmo ya.
7,Mon Oct 26 16:41:50 +0000 2020,@TBL06656392 @WestVirginiaU I plan on defending next semester 😣 Still so much to do so we'll see 🤞🏿
8,Mon Oct 26 16:40:07 +0000 2020,"@Garb0Garb0 @WestVirginiaU You're close! It's more like a ripple cuz these huge objects (i.e. black holes, neutron stars) are moving so fast through spacetime."
9,Mon Oct 26 16:38:04 +0000 2020,@QuantumWanderR @WestVirginiaU Aww thank you 🥺💜
10,Mon Oct 26 16:32:20 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU I never got cool swag when I got into WVU :(
11,Mon Oct 26 16:30:49 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Would love one of these as an alum 😅 Wish they sent these out 7 years ago 😂
12,Mon Oct 26 16:30:42 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU I would apply but my grades are absolutely terrible right now 😔
13,Mon Oct 26 16:03:35 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Scrolled past this while listening to a podcast about gravity and space curvature, probably a sign to ask a question I had: is a gravitational wave a curve in space moving away from a massive object that created it? Im sure it’s more complicated but am I close at all?"
14,Mon Oct 26 15:34:44 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Go WVU Mountaineers!
15,Mon Oct 26 14:02:09 +0000 2020,@WestVirginiaU Lovely..
16,Mon Oct 26 13:33:11 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU I wonder if a black hole is really a planet made of dark matter?
17,Mon Oct 26 12:43:43 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Swirly!

19,Mon Oct 26 12:26:06 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU That's rad.
20,Mon Oct 26 12:15:06 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU I applaud what you are doing. I take it you are using the radio telescope in WVA. I presume you have ties to Trinidad and Tobago?
21,Mon Oct 26 10:46:17 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Nice easy subject.  🤔
22,Mon Oct 26 09:56:58 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU gravity is strangely weak..

electromagnetic force is strangely strong..

like they are hand set values.."
23,Mon Oct 26 09:53:51 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Love this area of research.
24,Mon Oct 26 09:20:11 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Keep being awesome.  These gravitational wave graphics always show this plane.  I wonder now about the 90 degree or 45 degree plane and the relitaves strengths of waves in those planes.
25,Mon Oct 26 08:23:05 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU What do you mean by eccentric? Unusual in nature, or of unknown origin? Or both? Or what?"
26,Mon Oct 26 08:20:53 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @claudiascosmos @WestVirginiaU Good luck and thank you for the mental picture of GW dancing naked in the rain, wearing their underwear on their head. :)"
27,Mon Oct 26 07:32:38 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Good luck with your doctorate!  That subject sounds fascinating. All still very science fictional when I was an Astronomy student in 1978.
28,Mon Oct 26 07:06:33 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Nice. When do you defend?

Do you know the guys from Golm? They are so fluently solving equations and they helped me out several times."
29,Mon Oct 26 05:51:13 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Yes!! Love ya! and I’m jealous!
30,Mon Oct 26 05:45:06 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU There are eccentric gravitational waves? I can’t wrap my head around normal gravitational waves.

34,Mon Oct 26 04:26:05 +0000 2020,"@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU Hey you!  You are on my wavelength so I am giving you a follow.  As the father of a future astronaut daughter, happy to find another science role model for her."
35,Mon Oct 26 04:17:33 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @WestVirginiaU You're an inspiration!
36,Mon Oct 26 04:11:50 +0000 2020,@bdcheeseboro @TessEractica @WestVirginiaU I guess that kind of makes you an eccentric kind of gal.

I am not even sure we would have beaten FSU and they are awful. He is an offensive coach and that is the liability this year.

52,Sun Oct 25 01:24:51 +0000 2020,"@skiiiddy @WVUfootball @WestVirginiaU @NealBrown_WVU Hes absolutely a better recruiter than Dana, but those results are going to come quick. Dana at least won, and won big with Stewart recruits. The defense is loaded with talent he didnt recruit. If we had any semblance of an offense we would blow people out. Doege is his guy right"
53,Sun Oct 25 01:24:43 +0000 2020,"@kperreault70 @Ethanns2020 @WVUfootball @WestVirginiaU Doege did not run the ball once, had smoke opportunity to get 4-5 yards multiple times vs throwing high. No mobility and no arm strength."

Or he will call a wr screen that hasn't worked for 2 years. Oh the TE is eating them up? Lets throw to Sam ""Brick Hands"" James. He is gonna need to live at the sports psychologist house now. literal trash."
59,Sun Oct 25 01:03:51 +0000 2020,"3 things led to the @WVUfootball loss. @WestVirginiaU @WVUSports 
1. Penalties. So many missed. I hate to cry missed penalties but I saw at least 5 holds go uncalled and it may have been both ways but of course I have a biased view.
2. Dropped passes. 7 of them. They add up."

85,Sat Oct 24 17:49:22 +0000 2020,@IslandSilas @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball nation’s #1 D believe it or not. I haven’t seen a defense like this for WV in a while. Just jinxed their asses! They have the preseason Big 12 def. player of the year. Darius Stills. His brother plays right beside him. Their Dad was a WVU great and played 9 yrs in the NFL.
86,Sat Oct 24 17:47:23 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball @BillyGaither1 I was supportive back in the Blake bell days but the fan base makes them hard to like. And then just the type of team that the guys portrays themselves as. I remember WVU fans coming to our home games and they were great to get along with no matter what. I have a WVU hoodie lol
87,Sat Oct 24 17:44:16 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball I know right!! I’m hoping our offense will pull through! We had a slow start this year and definitely after our QB got hurt that put a kink in a few things. But luckily our redshirt QB was able to step up to the plate. I was watching WVU at the begining smash their first opponent
88,Sat Oct 24 17:43:57 +0000 2020,@IslandSilas @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball @BillyGaither1 When we joined the Big 12 I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the OK fan base. Exactly what you’re describing. I had no idea. I loved OK in the 70’s when they ran the wishbone. So many talented backs.
89,Sat Oct 24 17:41:38 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball Man you’re not kidding!! Me and @BillyGaither1  agree! They’re 2-2 now though! They talk a bunch of trash that’s why you can’t talk about football with them they think they’re Gods smh
90,Sat Oct 24 17:40:15 +0000 2020,@IslandSilas @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball I watch Ok State. Extremely talented. I know they have a finalist for RB of the year last year back and one for receiver of the year. And the QB is awesome. I watched the game he got hurt before you played us.

102,Sat Oct 24 17:23:12 +0000 2020,@wvthunder1422 @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball I think the mountaineers can pull through by around a 17 point win! My guess is somewhere around 17-38 WVU or maybe 10-24 WVU
103,Sat Oct 24 17:18:16 +0000 2020,@IslandSilas @WestVirginiaU @WVUfootball I sure as hell hope so. TT is down this year. But we’re on the road. Favored by about 3.
