Whats the deal for in-person classes tomorrow?"
1,Sun Oct 25 22:16:49 +0000 2020,"@AurariaCampus @CCDedu @msudenver @CUDenver Auraira owes it to students of color, [as well as queer and disabled students] to reinstate the CollegePass. This allows for low-income folks to wield a sense agency while they are preparing to become fully-realized professionals. 

It is unconscionable to take this from us."

Lastely and importantly,
For a center grant, you're working with a lot of colleagues on this; make sure you have a healthy working relationship with them!

What are your thoughts about U grants?

As with any grant, make it easy for the reviewer. Help them find the required info and review criteria (I‚Äôll come back to this later when I talk about my R35)

When I write a nontypical grant, I very carefully read and use language from the RFA.

For this RFA, the data analysis core was responsible for power, data management, and data analysis.  So aims were (1) study design, (2) data management, (3) data analysis

This mechanism was for a center that included 4 cores. I was the Data Analysis Core PI. 

Overall application was huge!
-6 pages for each core
