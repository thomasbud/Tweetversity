He made a joke about Isaac Asimov looking down on us from heaven, then said it had them rolling in the aisles when he said it at an atheists conference."

6,Sun Oct 25 15:20:52 +0000 2020,"@smithcollege How sad, that once again a speaker at the empty school will host a speaker, Lynn Nottage, for only their students, staff (and ex) and @5Colleges whilst the Town-people who always supported with care the Smithies as they crossed against lights, etc. WHY? @EsherMama"

I know we both think that her being on campus would be great, but we‚Äôve made the best of it with big weekend hikes and projects. It‚Äôs made the pandemic better-than-bearable for this single mom."

16,Sat Oct 24 16:22:12 +0000 2020,@JenniferNassour So social workers aren‚Äôt important enough to warrant the best education possible? What about teachers? Feel the same way? Our daughter is a sociology/English major @smithcollege and plans to apply to the masters program for social work. Couldn‚Äôt be prouder.

23,Fri Oct 23 13:52:36 +0000 2020,@lynnemthomas @smithcollege Same. It's going to be a long haul. Maybe many screams over a period of days?
24,Fri Oct 23 13:52:04 +0000 2020,@smithcollege And if so does that mean Hopkinites have to streak our neighbors?
25,Fri Oct 23 13:50:51 +0000 2020,@lemurchild @smithcollege (Especially since I‚Äôll be shocked if we have a full result less than 2-3 days later)
26,Fri Oct 23 13:50:20 +0000 2020,"@lemurchild @smithcollege That is more or less my assumption, either way."

40,Wed Oct 21 16:26:44 +0000 2020,"@bitnerd @smithcollege She was trying to grind through physics, thermodynamics, advanced calculus, mineralogy, and associated labs and it was too much without access to campus resources and friends. She's thinking about taking a spring semester at another engineering school that's stayed open."

45,Wed Oct 21 00:59:54 +0000 2020,@HilaryRoseD Definitely this. A professor at @smithcollege who I didn't know very well told me about REUs. I think it was something that she tells all students who come her way and are mildly interested in research/grad school. It's our job now to pay it forward.
