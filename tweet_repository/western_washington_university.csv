3,Wed Oct 21 23:22:12 +0000 2020,"@caprastro @WWU I know the answer at @UW is (as they said today) they handle thousands of grant submissions per year, and so I guess that level of service doesn't scale?... which I find unsatisfying. So we have dept folks try to fill the gaps, but can't do it all"
4,Wed Oct 21 23:20:02 +0000 2020,"@caprastro I greatly miss the grant management experience from my prev. university (@WWU). They provided end-to-end support with a truly personal touch. I worked with ONE person almost entirely, from drawing up budget to submission, and it was wonderful"
5,Wed Oct 21 22:27:48 +0000 2020,"I don’t know what @WWU student needs to hear this (I did!) but our Executive Director of Counseling, Health and Wellness center @DrSis is a WOC and after sobbing through her video message on Front Page I am effectively touched and feeling slightly better about being at #WWU 🖤"

9,Mon Oct 19 01:13:02 +0000 2020,"And the administration of @WWU hasn't cared about the community of Bellingham for decades. Move the fuck to Bellevue if you want to a taste of daddy's Mercer Island bank account so bad, and leave this community in peace."
10,Mon Oct 19 01:00:44 +0000 2020,Pretty much NONE of the @WWU students living in my building are wiling to wear masks in the common inside areas. So thanks Western. The upcoming body count is on you.
