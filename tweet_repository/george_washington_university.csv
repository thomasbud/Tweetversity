Savannah proved to me and America that she is not a journalist, she is nothing more than a biased, lying, partisan, hack.  Savannah why don't you interview Hunter again?"

Did she hear Trump was nominated 3x for 2020 Nobel Peace Prize &amp; 1x for 2021? Unfortunate that NBC won‚Äôt tell the public about the GOOD things that are happening in USA. Wouldn‚Äôt let public ask more questions.
