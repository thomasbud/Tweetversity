1,Mon Oct 26 18:04:08 +0000 2020,"@AmyJBrittain @CrimeWritersOn @reblavoie @LSU That makes sense. It’s the Indiana influence. I’m from the Pittsburgh area &amp; people can usually tell because of the “o”.   My mom is from the Philly area so I don’t sound completely Pittsburgh, which is COMPLETELY distinctive, if you’ve never heard it. Anyway, love your work!!!"
2,Mon Oct 26 17:43:59 +0000 2020,@mkline @CrimeWritersOn @reblavoie I was born and raised in Shreveport! Went to college @LSU. My dad is from Indiana. I had no idea I was even saying “Post” in a weird way until I heard from several listeners asking if I was from the Philly area. 😂 I guess I’ve adopted some mid-Atlantic speech patterns.
