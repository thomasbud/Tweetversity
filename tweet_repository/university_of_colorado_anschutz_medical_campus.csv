Lastely and importantly,
For a center grant, you're working with a lot of colleagues on this; make sure you have a healthy working relationship with them!

What are your thoughts about U grants?

(7/7)"
5,Fri Oct 23 19:22:56 +0000 2020,"@CUAnschutz @CUDenver U awards:

As with any grant, make it easy for the reviewer. Help them find the required info and review criteria (I‚Äôll come back to this later when I talk about my R35)

(6/)"
6,Fri Oct 23 19:21:11 +0000 2020,"@CUAnschutz @CUDenver U awards: 

When I write a nontypical grant, I very carefully read and use language from the RFA.

For this RFA, the data analysis core was responsible for power, data management, and data analysis.  So aims were (1) study design, (2) data management, (3) data analysis

7,Fri Oct 23 19:17:44 +0000 2020,"I recently submitted a U2C with amazing colleagues at @CUAnschutz @CUDenver 

This mechanism was for a center that included 4 cores. I was the Data Analysis Core PI. 

Overall application was huge!
-6 pages for each core
-6 pages for project
-12 pages for overall center
