25,Sun Oct 18 21:18:35 +0000 2020,@nrcamp @CheriWoods @aishatyler @urichmond I don't believe that any 1 study can accurately assess what millions of people are doing in the privacy of their own homes. The best they can do is interview a very small % of people &amp; ask them if they smoke weed. I'm sure they may get alot of dishonest responses as well.

Let's go back to the part where Black and white folks use marijuana at basically the same rate, but Black people are arrested for possession 3.6x as often. Is that ""committing more crimes?"""
31,Sun Oct 18 20:23:07 +0000 2020,"@nrcamp @CheriWoods @aishatyler @urichmond 3/3 the possibility that more black people get arrested &amp; go to jail is because they actually commit more crimes than white people, &amp; not some imaginary, invisible systemic prejudice?"
