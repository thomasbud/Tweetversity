1,Mon Oct 26 04:40:27 +0000 2020,@rachelsteenblik My BFF from @USUAggies and I had gotten a hotel in DC and had a nice night out for dinner and drinks... wanting to celebrated at WH... and as returns started coming in I started getting sick as I could see things where wrong.  Ended up crying ourselves to sleep in hotel.
2,Mon Oct 26 04:20:06 +0000 2020,@rachelsteenblik @JennyGarrard @USUAggies in the TSC. I had to study or take a test. I had done exit polling earlier and knew it was ugly in #utah. I was watching the returns come in with a Muslim student. We stood in absolute silence.  Exactly like 9/11
