18,Wed Oct 21 04:19:42 +0000 2020,"@scottpw7 @uafairbanks @Climatologist49 @ajatnuvuk @CinderBDT907 Good question. Hard to say between between the rapid changes and determining what is freeze-up. The 42 year passive microwave record is a blunt tool for nearshore ice, and the no long time series from the beach, and then the confound of what do do with ice moving in and out."
