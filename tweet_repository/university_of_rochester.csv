46,Tue Oct 20 13:38:24 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes As much as these kids get robbed and kidnapped.... 😂 This is hilarious. I think they should do it. Get rid of Campus Police and watch what happens. Ever hear of the “Felony foot bridge”?  It’s what RPD calls a bridge that links U of R to Plymouth Ave. Do It
47,Tue Oct 20 12:52:20 +0000 2020,"@HeckSociety @BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes In the middle of this global pandemic, your tweet is just dripping with irony."
48,Tue Oct 20 12:41:00 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes I would never had sent my child to a school that did not have campus security. This is getting out of hand.

50,Tue Oct 20 11:55:34 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes They’re so “woke.” Donate more to that sham BLM maybe. I know a couple of their members are looking for new vacation homes.
51,Tue Oct 20 11:34:03 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes Ignorance is bliss.
52,Tue Oct 20 11:23:56 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes College is not the place for you if you remotely support law enforcement. The U of R is no more hostile to cops than any other local college.
53,Tue Oct 20 11:22:05 +0000 2020,"@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes Who are these people who come up with these ideas?  Seriously, I am beginning to wonder if there is something in the city of Rochester water that is affecting brain function."
54,Tue Oct 20 11:13:27 +0000 2020,@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes Good way to ensure enrollment drops. What responsible parents send their kid away to a school with no Public Safety Dept? #TDS
55,Tue Oct 20 11:05:31 +0000 2020,"@BobLonsberry @UofR @campustimes Try  this on the river campus only. As the city of Rochester continues its meltdown and crime on river campus increases, Enrollment will drop and then a financially strapped UR will have to cut some of these nonsense departments."

61,Tue Oct 20 01:35:19 +0000 2020,@stillgrumpy2020 @JeffK72 @UofR That is not necessarily true.
62,Tue Oct 20 01:24:35 +0000 2020,@JeffK72 @ROCHNYCRIMEINFO @UofR I was up in CPEP with my 13 year old a couple yrs ago...waited in the waiting rm for 6 hrs and the PSYCHIATRIST came out and said her shift was ending and it would be a longer wait; she asked if I wanted to head HOME and call mobile crisis if needed. UMMM NO.

64,Tue Oct 20 00:31:12 +0000 2020,"@JeffK72 @UofR No question this is true, especially if patients are uncooperative. No money in admitting psych patients, especially if they’re on Medicaid or Medicare. I’ve made MHAs that were out before I was back to my patrol area."
65,Tue Oct 20 00:18:59 +0000 2020,@JeffK72 @UofR Not sure how that works with HIPAA. I  just checked the CDC site and no mention of law enforcement being privy to pt info. It’s how the laws are written. They have to rewrite the laws.
66,Tue Oct 20 00:13:39 +0000 2020,"@stillgrumpy2020 @UofR UofR was asked twice to communicate w/GatesPD when this patient was released. But they didn’t do it either time, allowing this person to endanger family &amp; public safety."
67,Mon Oct 19 23:55:47 +0000 2020,@JeffK72 @ROCHNYCRIMEINFO @UofR Look at Daniel Prude!
68,Mon Oct 19 23:43:40 +0000 2020,@JeffK72 @UofR You can’t hold someone against their will unless they are a clear danger or they voluntarily sign in for evaluation. Because how the current laws are written very little can be done in an acute care setting. MH are often a life long issue and there in no magic pill.
69,Mon Oct 19 23:38:20 +0000 2020,@JeffK72 @UofR Never have. Keep them minimum amount of time. They see the same people sometimes daily or weekly that should require more than a simple quick clearance
