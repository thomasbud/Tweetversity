OLV doesn't come close to meeting my family's need, but the help still means that I can go to bed Sundays at 11:00 rather than at 2:00 AM.  The situation still stinks, but it stinks a little less."

There are no great solutions. But yes also frustrated that college was prioritized over k-12."

For one, OLV and kidspirit are bandaids—impractical, short term care. More importantly, nearly every COVID-related decision OSU has made makes the reopening of Corvallis schools less likely. Shame."
