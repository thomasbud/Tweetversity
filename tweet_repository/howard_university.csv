Black culture largely is “frivolous” and “insubstantial.” For every Toni Morrison and Joy Reid, ten “bitches ain’t shit.”"

480,Mon Oct 19 18:44:28 +0000 2020,@WSpriggs @HowardU @HowardEcon The title is as exciting as it is encompassing of the challenges facing DRC. I can only imagine the headache the author must have suffered to bring to mind the atrocities again. Much appreciation because people will benefit from Ndungu’s work!

485,Mon Oct 19 18:25:42 +0000 2020,@JoeGawd @HowardU Humbly agree. I’m sure @ohiafterdark would too.
486,Mon Oct 19 18:04:54 +0000 2020,@GileadIni @JewessTi @AkivaMCohen @zayamensch @johnpaulpagano @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson It read pretty painfully.
487,Mon Oct 19 18:03:20 +0000 2020,"@GileadIni @JewessTi @zayamensch @johnpaulpagano @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson Correct. That's the issue here, not the article"
488,Mon Oct 19 17:41:54 +0000 2020,"@johnpaulpagano @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson I didn't know I ""became white"". Hitler didn't know it either when he murdered my family. And by all means, being an American is a privilege, so the one who claims others can't talk because ""privilege"" is a pot calling the kettle black. No pun intended."

493,Mon Oct 19 16:33:07 +0000 2020,@ArchitektonVade @johnpaulpagano @CHSommers @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson So it's okay if non-blacks support people who call blacks n****** and still maintaining anti-racism and social justice credentials because they do something for their group? Since when?
494,Mon Oct 19 16:32:12 +0000 2020,@Baddiel @johnpaulpagano @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson But let somebody say all lives matter or criticize Beyonce's hair and the s*** hits the fan period
495,Mon Oct 19 16:31:41 +0000 2020,"@S___Elliott @AkivaMCohen @johnpaulpagano @nytimes @HowardU @NatHopkinson If you mention Gandhi it is brought up that he was racist due to negative opinions he held when he was young of blacks. Anybody who praises Paula Deen, Roseanne barr, Michael Richards Morrissey will be shamed and reminded of their racism. But promoting Farrakhan gets a free pass."

She answered that loud and clear with her subsequent comments on Twitter."
