1,Sat Oct 24 08:33:00 +0000 2020,"@richtorrey @NYIslanders @HockeyHallFame @StLawrenceU You gotta love a guy who tied his own bowties. Bill's unofficial record for big bowties was when he drafted #BillyHarris, first @NYIslanders pick. (I have pix to prove it.)"

Luckily I lived in poverty for a decade to pay off @StLawrenceU debt. Now I am volunteering this week on communications career mentorship :)"

6,Fri Oct 23 10:30:14 +0000 2020,"@Bo_McDougall @StLawrenceU My daughter made the cookies about 3 weeks ago.  They were insanely good.  It isnt just the recipe, it is the portion size in the ice cream scoop that is critical too!"
7,Thu Oct 22 22:43:54 +0000 2020,"@StLawrenceU I wonder how many donors are aware of how you and your employee CHRISTIAN EXOO are being sued?

Best to give to the Red Cross instead!"

12,Thu Oct 22 15:56:03 +0000 2020,@BrCGoalieMuseum @mikecommito @LAKings @StLawrenceU I love those Kings jerseys and wish they owul dgo back ot them.
13,Thu Oct 22 15:46:49 +0000 2020,"@Kingstorian @mikecommito @LAKings @StLawrenceU Interesting - there's no real reason for them to sign him until the Hartford game (and he was on an ATO anyhow).  

I wonder if the Star-Phoenix was a late edition and someone made the deadline, or if they jumped the gun."
14,Thu Oct 22 15:34:00 +0000 2020,"@mikecommito @LAKings @StLawrenceU Watched him quite a bit during his @StLawrenceU days, was thrilled to see him make the show &amp; disappointed that his stay was so short"
15,Thu Oct 22 15:31:29 +0000 2020,@mikecommito @LAKings @StLawrenceU Oh my alma mater...and Gary Laskoski! SLU had some really good teams way back then. Hard to keep up today. Nice pull.
16,Thu Oct 22 15:31:21 +0000 2020,@mikecommito @LAKings @StLawrenceU I'm still surprised where they are (or aren't) on this.  We need a new Ron Andrews.
17,Thu Oct 22 15:24:28 +0000 2020,@GoalieHistory @LAKings @StLawrenceU There's a full-time job out there for someone to double check the NHL's and the HHOF's historical database
18,Thu Oct 22 11:41:52 +0000 2020,"@TheHockeyNews Was burned out after playing 13 years, K thru 12. Also, chose a college with a team that was better than I could make.  @StLawrenceU"
19,Wed Oct 21 22:37:11 +0000 2020,@StLawrenceU I wish we could get those here in NH.
20,Mon Oct 19 21:46:26 +0000 2020,"@StLawrenceU CHRISTIAN EXOO gets intel from conservative rallies and then doxes participants.  This is why he--and your so-called institution of higher learning--are being sued.

Yet he still works for you, meaning you have no sense of ethics whatsoever."
21,Mon Oct 19 21:31:39 +0000 2020,@SkidmoreCollege Would love to do this at @StLawrenceU! Please contact me at ctedford@stlawu.edu.
22,Mon Oct 19 00:46:36 +0000 2020,"@StLawrenceU Is CHRISTIAN EXOO working from home or is he back to using your computers to dox people?  

And how's the lawsuit going?"
