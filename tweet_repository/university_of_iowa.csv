The alternative would mean waiting at least a year, until the new wild-card president @UIowa is hired."
220,Mon Oct 19 22:10:56 +0000 2020,"@walflour @uiowa The only reason Gary Barta hasn't been fired to this point is that he's a useful dupe/shield for Ferentz, and tangentially so for Harreld.

Now that Harreld has quit on the school - pending appointment of his successor - Harreld also has no incentive to suck up to Barta any more."
