8,Mon Oct 19 11:07:10 +0000 2020,@abaukdiscussion Mind blowing! How this ‚Äòresearch‚Äô can pass an ethical review is beyond me. Waiting on @FloridaTech  to come out of their ABA cave to explain themselves.

10,Mon Oct 19 10:47:01 +0000 2020,@Traceylee1964 @FloridaTech care to explain yourselves to the autistic community?

14,Mon Oct 19 08:27:34 +0000 2020,"@AnnMemmott @aheeleyRIBA @NicholeConolly @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Their heads are stuck in the last century. No amount of people coming forward to condemn it or academic research disavowing it make any different to ABA apologists, it‚Äôs almost as if it were a cult. Believe, stay deaf to common sense, don‚Äôt read recent research and say ‚Äúgold std‚Äù"
15,Mon Oct 19 08:01:59 +0000 2020,"@sarahinthepark @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Indeed.
But somehow the ABA industry convinces people that autistic children aren't really children, and don't deserve all of the usual protections, as ABA is always in their best interests.  And, for some other reason, they get believed."
16,Mon Oct 19 07:56:45 +0000 2020,@AnnMemmott @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Yes i had to look at him for study he makes me cringe.
17,Mon Oct 19 07:51:59 +0000 2020,"@NicholeConolly @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Given ABA has Government-level support in the US, I doubt the Police would feel empowered to act.  No idea.
The difficulty is also that this is systemic.  The ABA industry has always regarded us as non-humans, and their sacred duty is to make us human by doing awful things to us"

20,Mon Oct 19 07:41:58 +0000 2020,"@AnnMemmott @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Surely they recognise telling a child to sit still and if they endure that behaviour they will be rewarded is grooming, wonder what the FL police force would think?"
21,Mon Oct 19 07:39:33 +0000 2020,"@NicholeConolly @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter One cannot help but note that the ABA industry invented its own hypothesis, and its own qualifications, and its own ethical standards.  
The last 50 years of behavioural progress, ethical understanding and knowledge re autistic culture &amp; communication hasn't happened, to them."
22,Mon Oct 19 07:38:10 +0000 2020,@AnnMemmott @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter Maybe cause they know they wouldn‚Äôt pass ethical standards?
23,Mon Oct 19 07:37:09 +0000 2020,"@NicholeConolly @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter The ABA industry doesn't appear to need to state anything about ethics in its papers.  Most odd, when the rest of us do.  But there again, looking at what they do to children, perhaps a deliberate omission?"
24,Mon Oct 19 07:27:32 +0000 2020,"@AnnMemmott @FloridaTech @TheScottCenter How did this pass ethics, this is grooming and sickening."
25,Sun Oct 18 12:00:33 +0000 2020,@JoelTooley @FloridaTech These stories are incredibly sad. I know college students in the same situation that are afraid to leave the US.
