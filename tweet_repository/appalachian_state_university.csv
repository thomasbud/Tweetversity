1,Sun Oct 25 17:47:38 +0000 2020,@Sub2ChristTrump @CalforNC @UNC @appstate Evidence is in the actions. He is never alone with another woman. He is courteous to others. He controls his anger. He is successful in his chosen field. He does not use profanity. He is a man present in his children‚Äôs lives. The main is that he is trying to make lives better.

6,Sat Oct 24 23:28:55 +0000 2020,@Sub2ChristTrump @CalforNC @UNC @appstate As a matter of fact the only politician I would consider being worthy of role model status is VP Mike Pence. The rest have the morals of stray dogs and alley cats. Cal Cunningham included.
