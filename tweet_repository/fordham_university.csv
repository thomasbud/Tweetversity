The jobs are there. I think the public needs a little more understand of what PhDs bring to the table too. Two things I think can help with this.
106,Wed Oct 21 15:06:56 +0000 2020,@C_OGallachoir @aidnography But we're trying to do better with that @josefkorbel. I'm just as proud of @JCPinckney's work at @USIP as I am of @RambaKy's service to the @USAFA_MSS. Same for @william_akoto @FordhamNYC and @billfishExpert @WWF!

108,Wed Oct 21 14:18:18 +0000 2020,@robertjdenault @SJPREP @FordhamNYC I love this Pope! His Jesuit view of our Catholic faith is what the far right Cathol8cs do not like. It's sad to read about Catholic leaders undermining this Pope.
109,Wed Oct 21 14:14:41 +0000 2020,"@robertjdenault @SJPREP @FordhamNYC My brothers were both Chaminade grads who went on to Fordham and NYU. 
Jesuit teachings are by far the most Christ-like imo, &amp; why I love this Pope so much."
110,Wed Oct 21 14:08:17 +0000 2020,"@BCrowe40765630 @robertjdenault @SJPREP @FordhamNYC Jesuits have their own dark history, yes. Their treatment of Jews in Spain in the 1600s for one too.
But they've more often than not being a bulwark against the Vatican establishment and pushed it toward progress."

It doesn't surprise me that leftist universities would take away guns, because they are largely involved with ""critical race theory"" and are wanting a Marxist government here."

I just bought a Springfield Armory Saint.  I am an older guy so the leftists can't ""cancel"" me.  I hope you are voting Republican this year because it will only get worse if Joe Biden/Kamala Harris are controlling this country."
