By the way, it is argued by the Onondagas that the origins of democracy started on the shores of their namesake lake pre- magma carta. Who’s to argue against that? Not me. Hope that explains."

The fans in CNY, just like in your hometown area love the game and show their support in ticket sales annually and always seem to be overlooked for such an important event. Overdue in my opinion. Nothing whatsoever on my part is meant"
412,Sun Oct 18 17:49:44 +0000 2020,"@jeffpaul @AnishESPN @SyracuseU 2. Going back to the days of RS Jr. who’s goalie was from the Onondaga Nation when he played, the tradition never ceased. Expand the game, honor the game, but my point was directed at Amish to suggest the simply because so much history in the game is from CNY doesn’t mean that it"

I played it, I coach it, I run a program of 400 kids. I attend laxcon annually. My position is simple: Syracuse U has done more to include players from the six nations than most schools and"

419,Sun Oct 18 00:42:26 +0000 2020,@SyracuseU Biko gray is the worst kind of racist and should not be allowed to shape young minds.  No child of mine will ever attend SU.  So disappointed.
