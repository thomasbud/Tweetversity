1,Sun Oct 25 14:09:47 +0000 2020,@XavierU Social justice virtue signaling is your LARP.  Our generation actually made huge changes in the social fabric of society.  You have the audacity to call us racists. Shame on you for destroying much of what we built.  America is still the best multicultural society on the planet.
