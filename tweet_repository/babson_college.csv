As a person who is trying to do a good job refereeing but never really knowing for sure if I am, I was curious if you have tip or two that you think could improve referee reports? (totally understand if not or if ""tips"" don't translate well for refereeing)"

14,Thu Oct 22 22:35:40 +0000 2020,@m_ratsim @JFPuget @nvidia @BU_Tweets @babson LOL. Thanks. Hi @bu_tweets and @babson. Actually that wasn‚Äôt what I was referring too.
15,Thu Oct 22 22:21:31 +0000 2020,"@judah @the_engi_nerd @JFPuget @nvidia Lovely, when you can't use facts i.e. showing your Kaggle team/profile or code you resort to ad hominem.

And you're a teacher at @BU_Tweets @babson 

‚ÄúIf the facts are against you, argue the law. [...] If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell‚Äù"
16,Thu Oct 22 22:12:44 +0000 2020,"@judah @JFPuget @nvidia ""I will show you if you buy"" is plain intimidation tactics. Quoting you is bullying you? @BU_Tweets @babson Judah is apparently among your faculty, are you fine with faculty using intimidation to market their product instead of proving themselves? Kaggle is public, comp/team?"
