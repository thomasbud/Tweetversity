7,Mon Oct 19 18:12:31 +0000 2020,"@DCInbox @heathbrown @wallethub @FollowStevens They list the schools they excluded on a separate page - my guess would be that they sent a survey to the schools, and didn't include any schools that didn't return it (they have a link for schools that want to be included in future years)."
8,Mon Oct 19 18:09:57 +0000 2020,@heathbrown @DCInbox @wallethub @FollowStevens Wow - it's worse in New York. Their rankings exclude all of the CUNYs and most of the SUNYs. Nonsense.
9,Mon Oct 19 18:09:44 +0000 2020,@DanCassino @DCInbox @wallethub @FollowStevens Hard to imagine a better bargain in NJ than Montclair State
10,Mon Oct 19 18:07:39 +0000 2020,"@heathbrown @DCInbox @wallethub @FollowStevens I mean, on what metric do you have data for Rutgers, but can't obtain it for Montclair State? Bizarre exclusions."
11,Mon Oct 19 18:06:51 +0000 2020,"@heathbrown @DCInbox @wallethub @FollowStevens They didn't rank a bunch of NJ schools, saying that didn't have data on them: Montclair, FDU, Drew, NJCU. So, I'm not taking these ratings too seriously."
12,Mon Oct 19 17:56:51 +0000 2020,@DCInbox @wallethub @FollowStevens Surprised Montclair State isn't in that top 10
