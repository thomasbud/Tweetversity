Freshmen are doing their work but most have been online since March &amp; never got a normal end to high school. Meanwhile, Uptown and off campus are having a life with peers. It‚Äôs all very sad #freshmenfirstinSpring"
110,Tue Oct 20 02:16:55 +0000 2020,@Hoffmanck @ohiou @gilice2011 @JennyHallJones @OHIOStudentLife @ohiouAdmissions It is so hard seeing all the schools posting their finalized spring plans and dates.  So many transferring now to have a campus experience in the spring. üíî
111,Tue Oct 20 02:14:25 +0000 2020,@gilice2011 @ohiou @JennyHallJones @OHIOStudentLife @ohiouAdmissions Thank you! We know you are üíö just scared for our freshmen in more ways than one ~ especially the ones who are watching the schools they turned down making it ‚Äúwork‚Äù #feelinghelpless  #wishweknewplans Freshmen need to feel wanted so they don‚Äôt leave. They are the future of OU!
112,Tue Oct 20 02:00:10 +0000 2020,@Hoffmanck @ohiou @JennyHallJones @OHIOStudentLife @ohiouAdmissions @Hoffmanck we are working hard here trying to keep the cases under control and planning for spring. @OHIOStudentLife and faculty are working to engage online students. This is hard on everyone! #workingaroundtheclock

114,Mon Oct 19 20:47:18 +0000 2020,@ohiou @OHIOPrezOffice @OHIOFineArts So why can't the rest of the University do this and get our kids back on campus?  Especially the Freshman.  You are losing tons of students!!  @ohiou @OHIOPrezOffice

122,Sun Oct 18 15:15:40 +0000 2020,@Coalguy1992 @ThePost @ohiou That was the first thing that popped in my head too.
123,Sun Oct 18 14:49:49 +0000 2020,@ThePost @ohiou Gotta be the dumbest thing I will see today.  Not that they had a 'gathering' but that kids whom are isolated are being investigated for having a party with other kids whom are also isolated.
124,Sun Oct 18 14:12:18 +0000 2020,"@fandggraff @ThePost @ohiou I don't know.  If outsiders were sneaking into the isolation house, that is definitely a separate, serious concern."
125,Sun Oct 18 13:53:21 +0000 2020,@Rhawk187 @ThePost @ohiou Was everyone at the gathering positive?
126,Sun Oct 18 09:57:16 +0000 2020,"@ThePost @ohiou Can‚Äôt afford to risk it, better just  bomb the whole campus."
127,Sun Oct 18 03:35:00 +0000 2020,"@Rhawk187 @ThePost @ohiou Obviously, viral load does matter. And the alcohol policy was breached. But it seems unlikely that students will get sicker from being in the same room as others. They are already infected. Imagine the psych burden of being in a bare room, alone, without your belongings even."
128,Sun Oct 18 03:33:27 +0000 2020,"@Rhawk187 @ThePost @ohiou I'd love to know if there's any evidence on viral load when it comes to people who are already infected. People with mild covid in China ‚Äì that is to say, people not sick enuf for hospital ‚Äì ""isolated"" in big gymnasium-like rooms. It kept spirits up &amp; allowed for monitoring."
129,Sun Oct 18 00:37:46 +0000 2020,@ThePost @ohiou Maybe bringing students back to Athens wasn't a good idea ü§î
130,Sun Oct 18 00:32:06 +0000 2020,"@ThePost @ohiou Part of me thinks if they are all already positive what's the harm, but viral load is a real thing and I imagine this can increase it."
