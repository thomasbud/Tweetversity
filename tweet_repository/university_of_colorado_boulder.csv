21,Sat Oct 24 01:07:19 +0000 2020,@marinavance @ShellyMBoulder @CUBoulder Why three days? We are starting virtual in the spring for about a week (after people return to town) and then having spring break spread through the semester in single day mini-breaks. So many different ways schools are handling this.
22,Sat Oct 24 00:47:23 +0000 2020,"@ShellyMBoulder @CUBoulder Nixing spring break was a good idea, starting the semester 3 days later was not a good idea in my opinion. Much better to start earlier and end earlier or, better, sprinkle those 3 days throughout the semester like they did with the other 2."

332,Sun Oct 18 06:33:40 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder There‚Äôs no acknowledgement of the extreme hardships students r under with quarantine n all recorded learnings. Any freshman joining is wasting their money. Talk to real students. Don‚Äôt believe the pretty pictures cuboulder posts.
333,Sun Oct 18 06:26:24 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder There is no campus life C19 hello! Your bury students with zoom work with no help available. What campus r u talking about?
334,Sun Oct 18 06:13:55 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder Ur not serious with all the fires n bad air quality?
335,Sun Oct 18 06:06:00 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder That‚Äôs a joke right?

340,Sat Oct 17 23:50:07 +0000 2020,"@EdwardKaihatsu @CUBoulder The wind is moving the fire east and north of Left Hand Canyon, away from the Boulder area. The CU campus is not under threat from this fire, except possibly from heavy smoke if the wind were to reverse direction."
341,Sat Oct 17 23:37:18 +0000 2020,"@CUBoulder These are alerts, notifications, definitions and a flood map. What about evacuation ?  On top of this evacuation with COVID-19 complications?"
342,Sat Oct 17 23:31:35 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder Jamestown is 16 miles away and they are evacuating. Does it looke@like the wind and fires are headed your way?
343,Sat Oct 17 23:21:49 +0000 2020,@CUBoulder Is there a plan to evacuate students and staff if the fires üî• get closer??
