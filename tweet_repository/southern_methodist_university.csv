121,Mon Oct 19 16:55:55 +0000 2020,@JueshaRawr @usta I think those two encounters say a lot more about HIS memory than MY memorability.  I saw him play live on multiple occasions at @smu's Moody Coliseum in WCT tournaments.  Beautiful topspin BH when that was a rarity. Not a bad serve either!

123,Mon Oct 19 04:02:03 +0000 2020,"@wseayjr @SMU_Football @SMU You are showing your own inner bias and ignorance. SMU only has 6,000 undergraduates. They have scholarships for ANY black or brown students who graduate in the Top 5% of their class and any who get an associates degree from DCCC. 100% for 4.0 graduates."
