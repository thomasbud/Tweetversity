0,Mon Oct 26 13:54:46 +0000 2020,@Shelcrafting @NAU Hi Shelby. The 2 biggest tips are to take the #CoETaIL course as it's incredible learning and to look into coaching training such as Cognitive Coaching. Looking into anything related to innovation and particularly Computer science could help too. Good luck!
