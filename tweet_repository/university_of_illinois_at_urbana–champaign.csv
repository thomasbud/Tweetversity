124,Thu Oct 22 21:56:27 +0000 2020,@EWoodhouse7 @Illinois_Alma My son had to get a flu shot to be on the college team. Two weeks later he decided he may not want to devote 24 hours a weeks to play. And got a bad cough around the same time. His job gave him three weeks off just to be safe. I'm freaking out and it's not even close to some.
