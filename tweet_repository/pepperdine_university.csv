50,Mon Oct 19 19:47:23 +0000 2020,"@PENGINDAKARA @PeppGraphic @PepperdineSPP @pepperdine Got it, in other words, you were wrong in your accusations. You accused the dean of embezzlement without real evidence or even a basic understanding around the powers he has to direct funds from his budget.

51,Mon Oct 19 19:42:52 +0000 2020,"@jcl4115 @PeppGraphic @PepperdineSPP @pepperdine I suppose you could argue that the intended purpose of the funds is in fact to support these kinds of organizations so in the letter of the law it‚Äôs not actually misappropriation. 

The lack of administrative approval is what makes that argument murky, however."
52,Mon Oct 19 19:39:55 +0000 2020,@jcl4115 @PeppGraphic @PepperdineSPP @pepperdine The article said he directed funds without the proper approval of the university officials.

54,Mon Oct 19 19:29:29 +0000 2020,"@jcl4115 @PeppGraphic @PepperdineSPP @pepperdine And frankly, it‚Äôs not my funds which he used. Therefore it is not my position to claim whether he needs to face legal ramifications. Only to assess his actions as right or wrong. Which is what we did just now."

80,Mon Oct 19 17:55:10 +0000 2020,"@jcl4115 @PeppGraphic @PepperdineSPP @pepperdine The only ""truth"" you've appealed to is that the 1619 Project has made revisions to their inaccurate statements.

117,Sun Oct 18 03:10:16 +0000 2020,"@pepperdine How is it that the president of a university like Pepperdine with its history (primarily on the LA campus) just doesn't get it. I graduated in 1981 and there has been a lot os ""resting"" going on in Malibu. Maybe he needs to go back to school. He just said ""all lives matter."""
118,Sun Oct 18 01:01:03 +0000 2020,"@JasonKashwer @colin_wiese @pepperdine Congrats 2 your son Jason, a proud new Cowboy alum, awesome. OSU made final selection tough but Colin is a born Californian &amp; it was going to be hard getting him out of state.Tough yes but we have our health,home &amp; wonderful, loving family...could be much worse. #2021WillBeBetter"
119,Sat Oct 17 23:51:34 +0000 2020,@wieseman44 @colin_wiese @pepperdine We were lucky. My youngest graduated OSU the year before COVID. Can‚Äôt imagine him being home doing distance learning this year and not being able to graduate in Gallagher. Feel for you and your son.
120,Sat Oct 17 19:47:57 +0000 2020,Obviously 2020 leaves much to be desired. Lives forever changed and mostly not for the better. Like many @colin_wiese ended his HS senior year distant learning and unfortunately his all important freshman year @pepperdine has started the same way. Obviously very frustrated but
