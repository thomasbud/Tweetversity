3,Sun Oct 25 21:32:15 +0000 2020,@JennyBoylan @wesleyan_u @GratefulDead @lemieuxdavid In 1983 went to see them for Fri &amp; Sat shows. I slept 2 nights at rest stop in New Haven. That was a 6 hr drive each way. I think Syracuse was the same distance.

You Are the Eyes of the World. 

Lost my ride home in the parking garage, would up in the back of somebody‚Äôs pickup. I stared up at the starry sky. It was cold.

7,Sun Oct 25 03:37:14 +0000 2020,@DavidVeevers1 The John Kennedy assassination. It was just before my 12th birthday (on which day Oswald was killed).  I was home from school and heard about it via radio - we didn‚Äôt have a TV. And my parents - a faculty couple at @Wesleyan_u - had a sherry party scheduled the next day. Not fun.

21,Mon Oct 19 22:54:17 +0000 2020,"@JennyBoylan @CraryAP @wesleyan_u @DayaShadowfax I‚Äôll find it. Tell me how to pronounce it, phonetically?"
22,Mon Oct 19 21:50:34 +0000 2020,@JennyBoylan @wesleyan_u Sounds better than the pinched nerve I first thought you were talking about!
23,Mon Oct 19 21:46:52 +0000 2020,"@lifeafterdawn @CraryAP @wesleyan_u @DayaShadowfax I think you can get it in one Italian specialty market there.  @DayaShadowfax knows where it is. But she has, alas, gone silent."

27,Mon Oct 19 12:40:09 +0000 2020,"@CraryAP @wesleyan_u You could get it at one pizzeria, D&amp;S, now closed. 

I am told it‚Äôs sold in one specialty store in Middletown now but I haven‚Äôt been there for a while. My friend @DayaShadowfax brought me one a couple years ago.  It was great."
28,Mon Oct 19 12:36:47 +0000 2020,"@BodyByEstrogen @wesleyan_u Both would be great.  Id prefer a loose sausage, like the kind you could cut open and saut√©. On regular sausage pizza I like habanero and mango sausage, which is quite a combination."
29,Mon Oct 19 03:47:11 +0000 2020,"@JennyBoylan @wesleyan_u Ok Jenny, I'll have to give this a try. Would it work with some andouille? Or you think maybe mexican chorizo?"
30,Mon Oct 19 01:57:47 +0000 2020,@JennyBoylan @wesleyan_u I had friends who went to Wesleyan in the 70s - I'm bitter they never told me about this.
