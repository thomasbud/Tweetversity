I just missed being a student in this school, I could study forever and not leaving it üë®üèª‚Äçüéì long time ago
Can you upgrade RT to master so, I can study? üë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è"
7,Thu Oct 22 19:13:53 +0000 2020,@TheTNHoller @etsu @Milligan_Univ @TriCitiesHoller So glad to see this. My son is in his second year at etsu and my daughter just got her acceptance letter yesterday.
8,Thu Oct 22 15:09:41 +0000 2020,It has been such a fun morning chatting with media communications students at @etsu.
9,Thu Oct 22 13:59:48 +0000 2020,@TheTNHoller @etsu @Milligan_Univ @TriCitiesHoller It‚Äôs almost like institutional discrimination applies to everyone except pedophiles around here.

11,Wed Oct 21 17:33:31 +0000 2020,"@abovejordan What happened in Lagos was kama, the prayed for it in 2014 and the will reap more because in 2019 too again they hide the truth this is just the beginning. @YeleSowore @Etsu @C1978J @jcamii2018"
12,Tue Oct 20 20:24:31 +0000 2020,Chair Dustin Kidd said he believes @etsu can carry a lot of weight among area colleges if the entire university adopts the gist of this resolution. Milligan isn't the only area Christian college that hasn't proactively pursued inclusive personnel policies.
13,Tue Oct 20 20:16:54 +0000 2020,Sponsor Seth Manning says the amended resolution is designed to be broadly supportable by @etsu administration and faculty senate. He says ETSU would reverse disaffiliation if changes in policy occurred Milligan or other institutions with similar policies.

15,Tue Oct 20 14:18:48 +0000 2020,Super excited to talk to an @etsu media class this week!
16,Mon Oct 19 13:43:09 +0000 2020,Shoutout to @ETSU for the parallel parking practice. Without it I may not have been able to vote today. üëåüèº

This place is basically brand new. Didn‚Äôt realize they canceled football from 2003-2015. Built a new stadium in 2017 &amp; won a conference title in 2018. Maybe there‚Äôs a connection between those two things?ü§î
