2,Sat Oct 24 12:41:38 +0000 2020,@corbinTD @CSBSJU When I saw them at the State Fair a couple years back (at your insistence) it was so life-giving I wanted to go home and cry.

6,Fri Oct 23 20:47:59 +0000 2020,I watched with my mom and it has sparked a wonderful conversation. This week Our @CSBSJU book club is discussing #Stamped From the Beginning. Thank you @DrIbram

8,Thu Oct 22 21:41:59 +0000 2020,"@LDJEconomics In my mind, the powerhouse double major at @CSBSJU is economics and @CSBSJUHistory! It's the key that unlocks the door to success! üîëüö™"

11,Mon Oct 19 15:47:12 +0000 2020,"@madisonc_morris @CSBSJU @csbsju_sfct Thanks! And thank you for bringing this event to my attention. I've been disappointed in CSB/SJU for a while, and this event obviously doesn't help that. It's too bad how far left they've moved since I graduated."
12,Mon Oct 19 15:45:15 +0000 2020,@AndrewJThom @CSBSJU @csbsju_sfct This is a great thread. Thanks for sharing!
13,Mon Oct 19 15:41:36 +0000 2020,College is supposed to prepare students for the real world by opening our minds and allowing us to form our own opinions. @CSBSJU is instead indoctrinating its students with liberal ideas while suppressing conservative viewpoints.
14,Mon Oct 19 15:41:36 +0000 2020,"If @CSBSJU wanted to create an inclusive environment for all, they would bring in someone alongside Mr. Kendi to have a discussion regarding critical race theory. But sponsoring this event with him alone does not allow the students to develop their own opinion."
15,Mon Oct 19 15:41:36 +0000 2020,The fact that a sophomore at a liberal arts school believes that freedom of speech should be eliminated is proof that @CSBSJU is not properly preparing its students for the real world. People don't lose their rights just because your feelings get hurt.
16,Mon Oct 19 13:49:23 +0000 2020,"‚ÄúEvery policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCapitalism is essentially racist... and racism is essentially capitalist.‚Äù 

This is what @CSBSJU is pushing students to attend."
17,Sun Oct 18 15:25:53 +0000 2020,"Standards for student : Grades, family income, course load, employment. ALWAYS a minimum payment required.
Standards for Institutions: Endowment health, graduate repayment metrics, employment metrics
@CSBSJU St Bens was in one report showing top 25 for overall repayment success!"
