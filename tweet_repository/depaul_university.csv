3,Fri Oct 23 18:43:34 +0000 2020,"Called in sick for my Wright tutoring shift today and cancelled my @DePaulU office hours. I had my flu shot and don't think it's #COVID (hope it's not). Seems like a bad cold coming on. Sneezing, congested, sore throat, fatigue, and some coughing. Have felt run down all week."
4,Fri Oct 23 18:38:05 +0000 2020,"The line ""Given the information gathered, we do NOT believe these cases are related to each other"" feels more disingenuous every time @DePaulU sends out another email about a confirmed Covid case on campus where the person was most recently at the gym."
