It's potentially fatal, and if not, can have long term effects

Not a good outcome for a trial"
47,Mon Oct 19 16:21:20 +0000 2020,@hurley_wj @myspacefiend @DrEricDing @UBuffalo There have been a lot of rare side effect syndromes related to medications. One of the more dramatic is Stevens-Johnson syndrome. So stranger things have happened.
48,Mon Oct 19 16:21:03 +0000 2020,"@braddeathridge @myspacefiend @DrEricDing @UBuffalo Very similar, but more acute, yes

I guess the only ""good thing"" about #GuillainBarre is it seems to be a one time only thing.

Since it's still relatively unresearched, there isn't a definitive cause of GBS, (inside speak for #GuillainBarre syndrome) but the rate at which vaccines cause ghb is about the same as the rate without, so, inconclusive"
