8,Mon Oct 26 16:23:04 +0000 2020,I was left with more questions than answers @AmericanU very disappointed with this communication about Spring 2021 semester. I genuinely feel as a grad student and an international student that I was left out of the conversation.
9,Mon Oct 26 16:21:09 +0000 2020,@AmericanU @Ryan_Deitsch If you want wanted to protect the health and safety of your ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù you wouldn‚Äôt be doubling the number of in person classes. There is no logical reason to cancel spring break if you didn‚Äôt cancel thanksgiving. Your plan is trash.

12,Mon Oct 26 16:11:46 +0000 2020,@AmericanU So many practices to learn from good (BU) and no so good. Let‚Äôs get going on asymptotic testing now and pilot it. You have students in and around campus.
13,Mon Oct 26 16:11:34 +0000 2020,@AmericanU sharing such a ‚Äúcomprehensive plan‚Äù for spring should require you to tell us how break days will be given. This blanket ‚Äúpromise‚Äù that breaks will be given throughout the semester is irresponsible. Students should feel empowered to make informed decisions.
14,Mon Oct 26 16:09:04 +0000 2020,@AmericanU There has been no new DHS guidelines in MONTHS and it would simply not go into effect until the start of the second semester. You should make a plan to let international come regardless.
15,Mon Oct 26 16:03:51 +0000 2020,@erinw_crim @AmericanU Are we talking about expanding mental health resources so you don't have to physically be located in DC to access them?

You guys are trying to be innovative but ultimately will have to cancel the semester last minute, screwing over swaths of students, because you‚Äôre reaching with this.
