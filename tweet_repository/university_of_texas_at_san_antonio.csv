Allowing Ss little breaks throughout the class day or having some movement exercises to keep them up would be beneficial. #MildModEdChat

38,Sat Oct 24 01:09:11 +0000 2020,@Al_Gomez_M @UTSA A1:Because some students with mild disabilities may have inefficient attention processes it is crucial that the instructor keeps the individual engaged so that they focus on one specific task at a time during their meeting. This will help them process more content. #MildModEdChat
