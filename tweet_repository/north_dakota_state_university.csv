4,Fri Oct 23 20:02:25 +0000 2020,"@NDSU We all heard North Dakotans are dying faster then any other human population on the planet.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?"
5,Fri Oct 23 11:50:03 +0000 2020,"@physicsnico @nksocialstudies @NDSU Yeah, the wording is just all sorts of wrong."

9,Thu Oct 22 15:51:54 +0000 2020,"@korytellers I think @NDSU should have placed the word ""testing"" after ""mass"" in their opening sentence. Otherwise it sounds as if they want students to get it."

Your selfishness extends beyond yourselves."
13,Sun Oct 18 01:23:31 +0000 2020,"Just saw a @NDSU commercial ad on @hulu streaming platform. It showcased a variety of students. 

The variety that was noticeably absent, however, was Native American students or really, minorities in general. There was one black student. That's it. That's unacceptable"
