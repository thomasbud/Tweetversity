They can be as corrupt as they like and never be prosecuted. Look at @tatereeves abuse of power in influencing the construction of a road between"

106,Sat Oct 17 23:04:59 +0000 2020,@chrispantages I don‚Äôt particularly have any strong feelings about any football team except the @OleMissRebels!

So tired of this narrative. @SECNetwork get somebody that will call the team by its real name. We are Ole Miss!Hotty toddy!"
