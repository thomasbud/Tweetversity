0,Mon Oct 26 18:02:21 +0000 2020,Submitted citizenship documentation for @BaruchCollege last semester and things went well. Somehow @NYStudentFinAid @FAFSA cannot pull up those documentations submitted and is asking for another submission of citizenship documentation this semester. Submitted it 4 weeks ago.

13,Fri Oct 23 16:10:18 +0000 2020,"@lavueltablog @BaruchCollege @Baruch_Weissman @Baruch_CTL @JCBLibrary This time we used Tulane's great photo collection. Overall, its a nice option that encourages critical thinking and student-led research, but is fairly low-stress and can be done asynchronously to make lemonade out of the lemons of having to teach online."
14,Fri Oct 23 16:06:25 +0000 2020,"@lavueltablog @BaruchCollege @Baruch_Weissman @Baruch_CTL Once I had a handle on the site, I created a series of module, asynchronous assignments (about one every 4 weeks) in which I introduce students to an online archive. Students then must select one archival doc/image and analyze it using our class readings and discussions"

Baruch has a great platform, Blogs at Baruch, which is a wordpress template that is ready-to-go for us (so even a tech-challenged person like me can operate it). @Baruch_CTL has also been great at giving tutorials in how to use the platform."
16,Fri Oct 23 15:34:29 +0000 2020,@BaruchCollege your offices are closed and no one is responding to calls/emails. How will students get help? Please advise.
