7,Sun Oct 25 04:47:26 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst Yeah I agree vitt hasn‚Äôt always done well against Tory  but McBride didn‚Äôt do much better against them this year. And again this Vitt didn‚Äôt have the line and weapons we have this year.
8,Sun Oct 25 04:41:14 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst He had a hell of a game.
9,Sun Oct 25 04:39:19 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst And I understand you can‚Äôt be bias but I mean he‚Äôs not doing good the he‚Äôs is improving and needs more rep can‚Äôt be an acceptable answer to fans maybe to the media it can but not to fans.
10,Sun Oct 25 04:38:01 +0000 2020,"@Keff_C @txst Most of the time the pocket breaks down cause he rolls so much. He loves to roll to his right and throw across his body. That‚Äôs not starter material.  He just did it again. 
Spav answer to your question is he improved but there is little follow up after that."
11,Sun Oct 25 04:37:17 +0000 2020,@roquesalinas2 @txst And Vitt threw four picks vs USA last year so...
12,Sun Oct 25 04:35:59 +0000 2020,@roquesalinas2 @txst USA beat ULM 38-14 today. They aren‚Äôt the same level.
13,Sun Oct 25 04:34:03 +0000 2020,@vol_jr @CBSSports @TxStateBobcats @txst @DanielsonCBS Half the week Georgia thong
14,Sun Oct 25 04:33:44 +0000 2020,"@roquesalinas2 @txst I have. Multiple times. Paraphrased answer: McBride extends plays with his feet  and is better at throwing on the run when the pocket breaks down. 

You act like this is a tough question for me to ask him. QB controversy all season, I‚Äôve asked this plenty. Pretty standard."
15,Sun Oct 25 04:33:12 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst That means that he‚Äôs not really to start so put in vitt.
16,Sun Oct 25 04:32:45 +0000 2020,"@kngsport @CBSSports @TxStateBobcats @txst @CBSSports @DanielsonCBS

Get rid of Danielson. He is awful. I bet he wears Alabama underwear."
17,Sun Oct 25 04:32:45 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst Fine then play him more to see what he can do against other team. And USA last week isn‚Äôt much higher on that list and McBride didn‚Äôt do good against them. Vitt did what he should have done against a bad team and McBride didn‚Äôt that‚Äôs my point.
18,Sun Oct 25 04:30:08 +0000 2020,"@roquesalinas2 @txst Played well against ULM, arguably the worst team in FBS."
19,Sun Oct 25 04:29:55 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst Then ask them on Tuesday why he doesn‚Äôt play vitt? Why does he continue to play with this guy? We saw vitt do good so what‚Äôs the hold up? Ask him. The whole yeah he needs more rep is over he has had 5 starts and they all look the same under 200 yards a game.
20,Sun Oct 25 04:27:44 +0000 2020,"@Keff_C @txst Yes vitt did throw picks but he didn‚Äôt have the team that McBride had this team. He didn‚Äôt have this offensive lines, these running backs, there is a reason Spav brought in 53 new players. When vitt played this year he did very well. If you aren‚Äôt worried about the spav or txst.."
21,Sun Oct 25 04:25:47 +0000 2020,@roquesalinas2 @txst You say ‚Äúbasic knowledge‚Äù but also say McBride looks down his receiver too much when that is exactly Vitt‚Äôs problem.
22,Sun Oct 25 04:24:15 +0000 2020,@roquesalinas2 @txst Bite the hand that feeds me? Bro. Idc who plays QB and I definitely don‚Äôt care about biting anyone‚Äôs hand. TXST or Spav or McBride doesn‚Äôt feed me. I don‚Äôt work for them. Vitt has thrown more interceptions than I can remember. So they are trying McBride. Too early to say he sucks
23,Sun Oct 25 04:10:33 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst Are you related to McBride? why do you continue to support the way this team is being managed? I understand it‚Äôs your job to report on the team and you don‚Äôt want to bite the hand that feeds you but Anyone with any basic knowledge knows that McBride is not doing a good job.
24,Sun Oct 25 04:07:10 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst he have been given too many opportunities hasn‚Äôt showed he‚Äôs the guy. This is simple Analysis of his play. If I was related to vitt I would have told him to quit the team for getting disrespected this year and last year too. It‚Äôs a shame what they are doing to him.
25,Sun Oct 25 04:03:14 +0000 2020,@Derrich @txst I mean McBride is 9-19 92 yards. But since he witness spav murder a random person he will not take him out and in fact spin how good he did against BYU in the media. I agree we want vitt!!!!
26,Sun Oct 25 04:02:07 +0000 2020,@roquesalinas2 @txst You‚Äôve hated McBride from the jump. You related to Vitt or something?
27,Sun Oct 25 04:00:28 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst He telegraphed who he was throwing it too the whole play before he rolled to his right and did the side arm. I don‚Äôt want Johnny football I want a consistent qb who knows how to read and go through the progression McBride is not that.
28,Sun Oct 25 03:44:25 +0000 2020,@CBSSports #danielson    should take lessons from commentators calling @TxStateBobcats @txst game. Compliments to both teams. No drooling over either team! No bias!!!! #VOLS #BobcatNation
29,Sun Oct 25 03:08:24 +0000 2020,@Keff_C @txst There is that 3 linemen and drop 8 zone. Might as well just remove 6 mins and give them 7 points. They are going to score again.
