20,Fri Oct 23 15:31:14 +0000 2020,@abisfab_ @uofl I understand the stress of having to get the flu shot. I wasn‚Äôt meaning to seem like I was saying that it‚Äôs not odd that the university is doing that. I‚Äôm just saying it makes since from a virology perspective. I think it just shows theyll probably require COVID vax when it comes
21,Fri Oct 23 15:27:43 +0000 2020,@chalpelphrey @uofl That part
22,Fri Oct 23 15:26:51 +0000 2020,"@abisfab_ @uofl exactly. it‚Äôs one thing to encourage getting the vaccine but requiring it is a different story, especially since most colleges are already doing mostly hybrid classes and requiring masks &amp; social distancing. the spread of the flu should be less likely to happen already."
23,Fri Oct 23 15:25:48 +0000 2020,"@aubrestephens_ @uofl But it‚Äôs different to require students to get COVID tests, which UofL has been doing through the semester and requiring them to get a vaccine. I‚Äôve never had the flu shot, and it quite literally has nothing to do with COVID. Any illness could increase chance to contract COVID"
24,Fri Oct 23 15:22:16 +0000 2020,"@abisfab_ @uofl I know a lot of hospitals that require it to work there. I think it‚Äôs suprising they‚Äôre doing it, but I think the logic behind it is that getting a flu outbreak on campus would likely lead to a COVID outbreak since immune systems would be compromised."
25,Fri Oct 23 15:13:08 +0000 2020,@chalpelphrey @uofl Well it‚Äôs kinda fucked up because it‚Äôs essentially the same as telling someone they have to take medicine. You can‚Äôt really do that. I get schools requiring COVID testing but requiring every student to get a vaccination is a whole different thing.
26,Fri Oct 23 15:11:41 +0000 2020,"@abisfab_ @uofl uk is too. it doesn‚Äôt make any sense because in the past, if you didn‚Äôt get a flu shot when doing your practicum placement or as an employee of uk, you had to wear a mask. if we‚Äôre all wearing masks anyway, why are we required to get a flu shot?"
