490,Thu Oct 22 20:31:14 +0000 2020,@utsystem @UTAustin UT-Austin was the last football team to win a national championship with zero African-Americans on the team because the @utsystem was racist and they are still racist.
491,Thu Oct 22 20:30:53 +0000 2020,"@utsystem @UTAustin *UT students try to change the world*
UT: Let me stop you right there"
492,Thu Oct 22 20:28:07 +0000 2020,@jdoliver @utsystem @UTAustin @TexasExes I Promise I’m not picking a fight. I’ve read the history and I want honestly to understand what words or phrases need to change to make it work.
493,Thu Oct 22 20:24:05 +0000 2020,"@utsystem @UTAustin How diverse is the UT Boards of Regents? Just because the racist history was only recently uncovered doesn't mean it should be accepted as ""tradition"". As a Life Member of @TexasExes and a woman of COLOR, I'm ashamed. The LEAST you should do is to CHANGE THE LYRICS to the song!!!"
494,Thu Oct 22 20:19:33 +0000 2020,@ReallyIanHughes @ctrob1971 @utsystem @UTAustin Funny how the University of Texas is one of the most diverse Universities in America. Leave the song alone. It's about tradition and that's it.
495,Thu Oct 22 20:15:59 +0000 2020,"@horns23 @utsystem @UTAustin I am not only an alumni but I was in longhorn band. I loved playing the song at the time, but after hearing of its racist undertones and origin, I am of the opinion we need to change it. People matter more than a song."
496,Thu Oct 22 20:14:59 +0000 2020,"@horns23 @utsystem @UTAustin Is a song that big a deal to you? The students are the ones that have to play it and sing it, so that seems like it matters. But you don’t go there?? I recommend finding an interesting hobby if this song is necessary to your life"
497,Thu Oct 22 20:14:18 +0000 2020,@darthnatalie @utsystem @UTAustin You clearly do not get it at all. You clearly are not an alumni. The song is not just a song. It is a song of school pride and doing our best. Those that want to buy into the garbage someone sold them can get on board or go elsewhere
498,Thu Oct 22 20:13:31 +0000 2020,@campusreform Nice job @UTAustin having a backbone &amp; pushing back against these little woke victimhood cry babies. Screw them. Pull their scholarships if they don’t want to play it. There are plenty of kids that will.
499,Thu Oct 22 20:12:37 +0000 2020,"@darthnatalie @utsystem @UTAustin No- there are thousands of us who went there, have kids there, and are taking graduate classes there or teach there. We love this university and are loyal to the school pride in that song! It is only positive! We are Longhorns forever. For those that do not agree - goodbye!"
