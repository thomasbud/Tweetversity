7,Sat Oct 24 00:02:16 +0000 2020,@waynestate I love you for encouraging profs to give mental health days next week ❣2/4 of my classes are canceled &amp; it is more needed than you know!!
8,Fri Oct 23 19:20:46 +0000 2020,"Read in the newspaper today that @waynestate is giving students October 30th as a mental health relaxation day for students. Being in a long stretch with no real breaks, I think @CMUniversity should consider a similar idea, considering that we are on a stretch from labor day"

20,Thu Oct 22 01:35:20 +0000 2020,@DetroittoAccra I’d never guess based on your town hall discussion today. You were so inviting and warm to students. @waynestate is beyond lucky to have you as a champion for student success!

36,Sun Oct 18 18:16:10 +0000 2020,@ebony_eason24 @waynestate Unfortunately the syllabus probably says it can be changed at any time and that’s why theyre allowed to get away with that shit 😕
37,Sun Oct 18 17:46:42 +0000 2020,My professor’s syllabus says our midterm is due the 26th then in the announcement he said the 23rd a few students emailed him and he pretty much said too bad you gotta adapt 🙃 and we can’t just live by the syllabus...what!? @waynestate
38,Sun Oct 18 17:19:13 +0000 2020,@nickdenardis @waynestate Awesome job!!!!
