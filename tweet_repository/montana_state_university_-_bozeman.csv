0,Mon Oct 26 16:39:44 +0000 2020,@Pflipsen6 I‚Äôm sorry this is your experience. I‚Äôm hearing these stories every day from all over the state but especially @montanastate. @WadedCruzado and @GovernorBullock should not put anyone in these life/death positions when solutions exist. Our students deserve better.
1,Mon Oct 26 12:02:30 +0000 2020,Power is out by Kirk Hill. Anyone know if @montanastate has power?
2,Sun Oct 25 19:32:27 +0000 2020,@montanastate @POTUS Nonresident students voting in Montana. Is this voter fraud?
3,Sat Oct 24 08:48:21 +0000 2020,"@betulland I got my PhD from @montanastate and as someone who follows up your work, I can totally understand why Montana is your happy place! Dr. Kacar, I hope you will also get chance to visit MSU in real life and see the beautiful Bridger mountains of Bozeman!"

Montana State is a special place for me, it introduced me to 1) Yellowstone &amp; extremophiles in the field 2) astrobiological biochemistry. Montana is my happy place, thank you!"
7,Fri Oct 23 19:48:16 +0000 2020,"@montanastate is risking everyone‚Äôs health so that they can continue to make a quick dollar off of their exorbitant dorm fees.

Every friend group I know has at least one person with Covid. Remote instruction now!"

12,Thu Oct 22 20:01:43 +0000 2020,"@RyTriGuy @montanastate @msuchembiochem So, someday I‚Äôll be able to call you Dr. J?"
13,Thu Oct 22 18:55:06 +0000 2020,@MrYennePaul @montanastate @msuchembiochem I‚Äôm from there! üòäüòçüèî
14,Thu Oct 22 18:37:33 +0000 2020,"@RyTriGuy @montanastate @msuchembiochem Would you actually go up to MT? It's my favorite, non-CO state and I would be jealous."
15,Thu Oct 22 18:17:03 +0000 2020,@nmr_chemist @montanastate @msuchembiochem BOOM.
16,Thu Oct 22 18:16:03 +0000 2020,"@nmr_chemist @montanastate @msuchembiochem No, sorry, chemistry education research. MSU doesn‚Äôt have a ChemED program/track, to my knowledge...but maybe they‚Äôll let me build it for them? ü§î"
17,Thu Oct 22 18:15:24 +0000 2020,@nmr_chemist @montanastate @msuchembiochem That too. Me and Conrad Anker are gonna be pals. üòú
18,Thu Oct 22 18:15:24 +0000 2020,@RyTriGuy @montanastate @msuchembiochem Like the teaching model CER?

25,Wed Oct 21 19:47:16 +0000 2020,@montanastate needs to do a better job enforcing masks. Many students wear masks below their nose/mouth or take masks off completely while indoors on campus. My concerns have been met with indifference by MSU. Make campus safe or offer remote option. @GallatinHealth @liz_a_weber
26,Wed Oct 21 19:15:33 +0000 2020,@montanastate MSU needs to do a better job enforcing face coverings. Many students wear masks below their nose/mouth while indoors. I also see students completely remove their masks after class ends and stay in the classrooms to socialize. My concerns have been met with indifference by MSU.
27,Wed Oct 21 15:56:21 +0000 2020,Great work @CovidDashboards. Looking forward to seeing @montanastate achieve the excellence we're known for and improve our F grade.
28,Wed Oct 21 04:14:32 +0000 2020,"An ironic thing about @GregForMontana - he has a School of Computer Science at @montanastate named after him (or rather, his money), and yet he's not a big fan of ""science"" (generally speaking)."
