0,Mon Oct 26 18:52:09 +0000 2020,@VanderbiltU @CarolSwain4Nash Swain bribes black cops with doughnuts &amp; coffee so they don't abuse and/or abandon other members of their community.  But what are conspicuous colored citizens supposed to do when Krispy Kremes and Starbucks is closed? #UShouldaBeenBreonaTaylor
1,Mon Oct 26 18:43:45 +0000 2020,@VanderbiltU If anyone thinks my #UShouldaBeenBreonaTaylor hashtag is threatening or inappropriate he/she should know that former Professor Carol Swain held an appreciation ceremony for black police officers many of whom abuse other members of their racial community.
2,Mon Oct 26 18:13:25 +0000 2020,@VanderbiltU @CurwoodA @ArtColumbia #UCannotSpeakDespitethaConstitution I want 2 connect Pro Anastasia Curwood from VU with Rebecca Godfrey from Columbia MFA.

7,Mon Oct 26 17:32:07 +0000 2020,@VanderbiltU #CurwoodA  My relationship with Prof Curwood is a good example of why I created the #myblacklifematters2me movement - I have to be Black American alone but I am a better Black person than Curwood b/c I take my connection to abused members of my community seriously
8,Mon Oct 26 17:27:36 +0000 2020,@vanderbiltU @CurwoodA Many members of the African American and/or Black community are comfortable in a culture where they refuse to acknowledge each other during times of abuse.  People like Curwood discredit the black lives matter movement from within the community itself.
