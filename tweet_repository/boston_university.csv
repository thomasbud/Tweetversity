314,Wed Oct 21 02:51:40 +0000 2020,@adamPDOTcom @MassDOT @PeoplesPike @BU_Tweets Transformative. They know it. Just need to open minds.
315,Wed Oct 21 02:50:18 +0000 2020,@nathanpboston @MassDOT @PeoplesPike Perhaps @BU_Tweets wants to submit what a BU Beach without Storrow Drive blocking water access would look like?
316,Wed Oct 21 02:49:15 +0000 2020,@nathanpboston @ThomasConnors @MassDOT @ABetterCity @StreetsBoston @bostonbikeunion @BU_Tweets Wonder if @adamtvaccaro noticed this at either meeting.
317,Wed Oct 21 02:45:58 +0000 2020,@nathanpboston @ThomasConnors @MassDOT @ABetterCity @StreetsBoston @bostonbikeunion @BU_Tweets It was also noted the same question was asked and answered at one of the earlier meetings not sure if last night or some other meeting.
318,Wed Oct 21 02:45:02 +0000 2020,@adamPDOTcom @ThomasConnors @MassDOT @ABetterCity @StreetsBoston @bostonbikeunion @BU_Tweets Thank you - it’s a remarkable opening if @MassDOT is serious.
319,Wed Oct 21 02:43:06 +0000 2020,"@nathanpboston @ThomasConnors @MassDOT @ABetterCity @StreetsBoston @bostonbikeunion @BU_Tweets Good question, I can't remember. It wasn't Nate, would have to look back at the recording when it's online."
320,Wed Oct 21 02:41:09 +0000 2020,@adamPDOTcom @ThomasConnors @MassDOT @ABetterCity @StreetsBoston @bostonbikeunion @BU_Tweets Who was the @MassDOT person who said this?
321,Wed Oct 21 02:34:52 +0000 2020,"@Misterthemoney @BU_Tweets Not to mention, there was no spike.  99.89% negative tests yeasterday vs. 99.93% cum since July.  Give me a break."
322,Wed Oct 21 02:27:44 +0000 2020,"@charlesriver We need to restore the land the Storrows donated to what they wanted it to be and what it was always meant to be which is a park!

Close Soldiers Field Road &amp; close Storrow Drive up to at least Kenmore so that the @BU_Tweets beach actually has water access! Soldiers Field Park!"
323,Tue Oct 20 19:41:20 +0000 2020,Thanks friends at  @BU_Tweets !  Still looking for tips to get ready for tomorrow's fair? Hey BU has you covered.  ://twitter.com/BU_Tweets/status/1318282217139900418
324,Tue Oct 20 19:34:06 +0000 2020,"@BU_Tweets Is there any evidence this will help at all? Seems like all it's going to do is slow down how fast people can access these places, leaving them in non distanced lines for minutes. Not to mention it's far more likely that most of the spread is coming from dorms and off campus."
325,Tue Oct 20 19:30:01 +0000 2020,@bu_phd_students @BU_Tweets Wow...Glad I can be remote this semester but very worried for all those who can’t be.
326,Tue Oct 20 19:27:31 +0000 2020,"@brubakerl @BU_Tweets It was left up to professors whether or not they checked badges before students entered rooms, but as far as we know there was no systematic checking of badges before entering buildings."
327,Tue Oct 20 19:26:28 +0000 2020,@bu_phd_students @BU_Tweets Wait so they weren’t doing this before? Just to get into classes or what?
