19,Wed Oct 21 18:53:30 +0000 2020,"@BreckLandscape @MCWPresident @MKEBizJournal @MedicalCollege @GovEvers What study said that 40% compliance is the magic number?

It could be testing, cycles, and data point aggregation, but at this point it is just conjecture and not scientific analysis."
20,Wed Oct 21 18:15:24 +0000 2020,@BreckLandscape @MCWPresident @MKEBizJournal @MedicalCollege @GovEvers It is mainly spread through respiratory droplets. So the other variable would be if you spend time within 6 feet of someone who is infected. Since masks are effective at capturing respiratory droplets they help to reduce the viral load.
21,Wed Oct 21 17:37:29 +0000 2020,@BreckLandscape @MCWPresident @MKEBizJournal @MedicalCollege @GovEvers In the study everything is normalized to 1 based on no mask wearing.

My question, however, revolves around the assumption that even though we implemented these measures, cases rose and the cause was improper or non compliance. 

Where‚Äôs the control group?"
24,Wed Oct 21 16:38:45 +0000 2020,@BreckLandscape @MCWPresident @MDardanius @MKEBizJournal @MedicalCollege @GovEvers So you know more than the president of one of the top 500 universities on the planet now? This is peak Twitter.

There are an infinite number of variables therefore no way to determine how many people wore masks in various parts of the state, how often/long they wore them and if they wore them properly."
26,Wed Oct 21 15:46:51 +0000 2020,"@MDardanius @BreckLandscape @MKEBizJournal @MedicalCollege @GovEvers Thank you, Mike. That's part of it, but there is pandemic fatigue everywhere."

Masks work when enough people wear them properly, and do what they can to reduce the number, intensity, duration and proximity of potential exposures."
