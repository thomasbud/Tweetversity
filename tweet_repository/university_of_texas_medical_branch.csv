6,Wed Oct 21 21:18:34 +0000 2020,@MichaelPSenger @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth This is an interesting theory that I‚Äôve missed. And when you think about their miraculous economic recovery and seemingly lack of COVID concern *now*...it makes a lot of sense.
7,Wed Oct 21 17:20:55 +0000 2020,@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Probably some ü§ê $ involved too... may be wise to look at that side of things.. maybe?
8,Wed Oct 21 17:02:21 +0000 2020,"@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth What? Because a BSL4 lab in the United States worked with a BSL4 lab in China you suspect they knew something sinister about the Coronavirus how absurd!
Rest assured our own government knew about the coronavirus we have  the CIA they're not incompetent."
9,Wed Oct 21 16:26:05 +0000 2020,"@Broncos27 @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth he‚Äôs smart and well researched and makes valid points, which should be considered.  I don‚Äôt care that he‚Äôs mean, but he is selective in his reporting and verging on a propagandist.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs red, I think he‚Äôs an opportunist, which is fine but it should be pointed out."
10,Wed Oct 21 16:11:25 +0000 2020,@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Maybe that explains why @GovAbbott seems to still be acting like we have a covid19 problem in Texas instead of acting like florida...
11,Wed Oct 21 15:42:57 +0000 2020,"@wait4thegoodlif @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Yes. N-95 masks and space. 
No, but everybody isn‚Äôt smart. Like *blindly* following the Orange man. 

Email Berenson. If you assume he‚Äôs politically Red, you‚Äôd be wrong. His isn‚Äôt a political crusade, but one for truth (so he says) and open debate. But being mean hurts his rep"
12,Wed Oct 21 15:39:17 +0000 2020,@wait4thegoodlif @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth You're evading the question Bradley (or is it Bradley Mark). Please find one where he calls Covid benign. Thanks much.
13,Wed Oct 21 15:38:55 +0000 2020,"@kayceeinva @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth They call it 'gain of function' - In other words, they try to modify these viruses so that they CAN infect humans. Then, as the story goes, they can learn how to cure them. 

Seems like a great idea, considering they can't even cure the mild human flu/corona viruses."
14,Wed Oct 21 15:27:49 +0000 2020,@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth welp
15,Wed Oct 21 15:14:53 +0000 2020,"@Broncos27 @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Is any amount of precaution appropriate?  Are large, unmasked political rallies smart?  Filling football stadiums?"

Please show where hospitals are not a accepting patients or a massive need for ventilators or maybe a portable field hospital.  Remember cases are just positive tests. They are not sick.

20,Wed Oct 21 14:55:18 +0000 2020,"@wait4thegoodlif @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Well, again, all or nothing thinking can bite here, too. There are lazy idiots that say it then leave it at that. 
I subscribe to ‚ÄòVirus gonna Virus‚Äô in that outside of lvl 4 PPE or complete isolation, a virus this wildly contagious is nearly impossible to contain/control."
21,Wed Oct 21 14:32:05 +0000 2020,@Broncos27 @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth So the virus is not ignorable.  Where does the phrase ‚Äúvirus going to virus‚Äù fit in then?
22,Wed Oct 21 14:25:25 +0000 2020,"@wait4thegoodlif @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Here‚Äôs help
‚ÄúAlleged‚Äù = relatively (to actual horrific dangers, i.e. heart disease, cancer)
‚ÄúCatastrophe‚Äù = issue
Nobody thinks it‚Äôs fake, nor ignorable. This all-or-nothing approach kills the ability to reason, i.e. Under Control versus Catastrophic. Put simply, It‚Äôs fear bruh"
23,Wed Oct 21 14:14:11 +0000 2020,"@linn_baxter @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Oh ho, so the narrative is shifting!  I presume you and Alex download your thoughts from similarly deranged conspiracy touting chat rooms.  As to your question, hit any tweet of his at random over the last 4 months."
24,Wed Oct 21 14:08:36 +0000 2020,"@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Jeezus, you were always a bit loony, but you have totally flipped out now.   Get some professional help."
25,Wed Oct 21 14:03:40 +0000 2020,"@wait4thegoodlif @AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Hi Bradley! Can you please refer me to a tweet where Alex says the virus is ""benign?"" Because I must have missed it!"
26,Wed Oct 21 13:57:56 +0000 2020,"@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Does your increased focus on the origins of the virus, as opposed to your typical selective reporting on its alleged benign nature, reflect growing awareness of the potential public health  catastrophe developing in the Midwest?"
27,Wed Oct 21 13:52:40 +0000 2020,@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Woohoo! Berenson's going full Plandemic for the final stretch!
28,Wed Oct 21 13:52:00 +0000 2020,@AlexBerenson @utmbhealth Between this and the Biden family‚Äôs allegedly sickening behavior we‚Äôre going to need a vacation for goodness sakes it‚Äôs just all too much.
