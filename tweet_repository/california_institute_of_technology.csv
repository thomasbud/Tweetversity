70,Thu Oct 22 19:09:11 +0000 2020,@ZongyiLiCaltech @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech Is velocity larger when reducing viscosity (in your normalization of forcing)?

110,Thu Oct 22 10:37:32 +0000 2020,@ZongyiLiCaltech @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech So you're basically using the greens function as a 'good guess' for the operator and then improve on it using your activation function?

I am interested in problems with complex geometries. But uniform grids are not of much help for such problems.  Given my limited knowledge in NNs, I am happy to use your model based on graph-based methods as a black-box to run some benchmarks. Could you please share?"
112,Thu Oct 22 09:12:18 +0000 2020,"@GJ_Both @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech Good question! The neural operator composes linear integral operators (Greens function) with non-linear operators (activation functions). Just like neural networks can approximate highly non-linear functions, our model can approximate non-linear operators / non-linear PDEs."

To train the neural operator, we need to have a dataset of inputs and outputs. So if this dataset consists of only one equation, it will be hard to train the operator."
115,Thu Oct 22 08:31:37 +0000 2020,"@five9a2 @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech Good question! Our ground truth data are generated with resolution 256*256 and delta_t=1e-4. 
If we set delta_t=1e-3, it gets ~1.4% error compared to the 1e-4 one; if delta_t=1e-2, it gets ~2.3% error; with 1e-1, it blows up. Our method does as good as the 1e-3 one."
116,Thu Oct 22 07:36:25 +0000 2020,"@AnimaAnandkumar @ZongyiLiCaltech @kazizzad @Caltech But you do show that it works really well on non-linear equations, so is your model implicitly linearizing the underlying PDE?"

Also, have you tested the Darcy method with high-contrast coefficients and coherent structures, such as a layer of SPE10 benchmark?"
119,Thu Oct 22 04:43:13 +0000 2020,"@five9a2 @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech Hi Jed, in the paper we do [0,10] -&gt; [0, T] just to compare with the existing RNN-based methods. Our method can indeed work on 0 -&gt; [0, T] or 0 -&gt; T. 
For the Re=1000 case, the 3d-Fourier method gets ~0.8% error on [0,10]-&gt;[0,T]; ~1.2% error on 0-&gt;[0, T]; and ~2% error on 0-&gt;T."

121,Thu Oct 22 03:47:41 +0000 2020,@kazizzad @ZongyiLiCaltech @AnimaAnandkumar @Caltech I agree. But I always thought ‚Äútrick‚Äù is a positive comment on its cleverness. :)
122,Thu Oct 22 03:45:28 +0000 2020,@AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech This is actually pretty amazing! Are there any particularly interesting applications you envision for this method?

126,Thu Oct 22 02:58:41 +0000 2020,"@ZongyiLiCaltech @AnimaAnandkumar @kazizzad @Caltech When you say learning the operator in the infinite dimensional space, is it analogous to using the kernel trick in classical regression methods (but applied to the PDE fourier ansatz)? Thanks :)"
