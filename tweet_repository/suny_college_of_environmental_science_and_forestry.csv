Porter &amp; his students helped me get back on my feet, gave me field exp/mentorship &amp; support for grad school. I‚Äôll never forget winter mammal eco &amp; my time at AES! He was a great person &amp; a wonderful scientist!"
1,Mon Oct 26 02:52:50 +0000 2020,@BatmanateePhD @sunyesf He was instrumental in seeing me through to my first peer-reviewed journal article. I was always deeply appreciative and it‚Äôs shaped how I tackle peer review.

3,Sun Oct 25 23:48:44 +0000 2020,@BatmanateePhD @sunyesf So sad. Thanks for sharing. I will never forget taking his wildlife management course during my first semester at ESF‚Äî you were my TA!

6,Sun Oct 25 13:50:12 +0000 2020,@RachaelEBee @bradcosentino @sunyesf I‚Äôve hunted them for almost 30 years &amp; come from a long line of squirrel hunters.
