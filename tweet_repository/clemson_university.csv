131,Sat Oct 17 23:07:33 +0000 2020,@birbpower @ATG_Network @ClemsonUniv The hate on grape flavored things has gone too far. Grape Gatorade Zero? Delicious.

135,Sat Oct 17 21:04:35 +0000 2020,"@ClemsonPrez @ClemsonUniv @clemsonbusiness Seriously, nobody bothered to ask the Powers to share some of that fortune to prevent further furloughs? But hey, at least they got their name on something."
136,Sat Oct 17 21:03:29 +0000 2020,"@ClemsonPrez @ClemsonUniv @clemsonbusiness Meanwhile, the University is furloughing it‚Äôs employees. Someone‚Äôs priorities are off. Donors? Development office? CFO? A favorite refrain of CU executive leadership: That money‚Äôs not for you."

140,Sat Oct 17 19:24:27 +0000 2020,@JasonCusterPhD @ClemsonUniv Haha. Maybe. Also it's not even like Clemson is running up the score. It was 52-3 at halftime and they put in third stringers. That's a rough three hours for Georgia tech
141,Sat Oct 17 19:23:43 +0000 2020,@DuvallTweets706 @ClemsonUniv üòÇ Good luck today!
