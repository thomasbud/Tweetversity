345,Sun Oct 18 15:12:58 +0000 2020,"@JayThom30765998 @lukassulskis @KaitMarieox @UCF clearly you dont know what freedom of speech is. ‚Äúfacts matter, feelings are irrelevant,‚Äù if i want to call someone a cunt based on my feelings, thats my freedom of speech. if i want to debate them using facts, that is ALSO my freedom of speech. it goes both ways."
346,Sun Oct 18 14:15:03 +0000 2020,"@Jason71540651 @lukassulskis @KaitMarieox @UCF Take a moment to learn some history. Not the fictional history. Tell me how you view what fascism is? 
Freedom of speech is to be able to agree to disagree by open conversation. Facts do matter, feelings are irrelevant. That is where conversations on many college campuses fail."
