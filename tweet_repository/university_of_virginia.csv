230,Tue Oct 20 01:33:17 +0000 2020,"@boltyboy @UVA Which is to say it's not enough for UVA to disregard old judgments and liens or return the money. A judgment in the land record messes you up multiple ways, including your credit score."
231,Tue Oct 20 01:30:38 +0000 2020,@boltyboy @UVA You asked about UVA Health endowment. Below are financials for FY2019 - close to $1b in investments. To do right they *have* to release the liens at the courthouse. The title companies that actually enforce the liens. They'll delay/ kill a house sale deal if a lien is there.
232,Tue Oct 20 01:23:06 +0000 2020,"@jayhancock1 @UVA @uva med center operations are broken out in that doc. About $1.8bn rev with ~$200m profit in 2019.

Amazing that they've done nothing since your report last year. Presumably they could agree to not enforce any liens or return any$$ they get from them?"
233,Tue Oct 20 01:14:55 +0000 2020,@boltyboy @UVA Thanks Matthew! I have it somewhere. UVA Health has its own endowment. We pegged it at close to a billion a year ago. I have it somewhere but have to nose around a bit -- the UVA Health-only financial statements are hard to find &amp; it has been awhile.
234,Tue Oct 20 01:08:45 +0000 2020,@jayhancock1 More fantastic work @jayhancock1 -- one question. Did you find out about @uvahealthnews $$ reserves separate from the @UVA endowment which seems to be $7bn?
