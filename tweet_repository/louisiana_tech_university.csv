He came here to compete and stamp out the competition, like me."
55,Tue Oct 20 20:00:45 +0000 2020,@UltimateBeing01 @LATech Oh I'm sure it's everyone else who's the problem. Including a professor who had to endure red fascism before coming to America for a better life. Good luck with your revolution though.

60,Mon Oct 19 16:24:56 +0000 2020,"@RTMannJr @LATech @drewmckevitt Truly disheartening, but true of this moment. 
Critical thinking be dammed."
61,Mon Oct 19 15:37:18 +0000 2020,"@drewmckevitt @LDBurnett @LATech Yes, that‚Äôs what I was thinking.  They assume they will deal with local press, not a shitstorm ignited by a right-wing disinformation rag."
62,Mon Oct 19 15:34:20 +0000 2020,"@susandamussen @LDBurnett @LATech I think there's something to that but in the article in which I appeared they also named profs from Penn, Northwestern, and UMich. As far as I know, those places ignored it, perhaps because they've been here before. Admins at less prominent institutions haven't."
63,Mon Oct 19 15:29:46 +0000 2020,"@LDBurnett @drewmckevitt @LATech I think it‚Äôs interesting that they are targeting lesser none, local serving institutions- who they assume (rightly, apparently) will be too craven to push back."
64,Mon Oct 19 15:17:55 +0000 2020,@LDBurnett @drewmckevitt @LATech I wish someone from @umich would follow up with our own incident of admin caving to r/w pressure. I‚Äôd do it myself but can‚Äôt as I was ombuds at the time.
65,Mon Oct 19 14:51:26 +0000 2020,"@drewmckevitt @RTMannJr @LATech I will say, I stand with you on this situation. We need our higher education institutions to respect the freedom of speech and scholarship of its faculty, however that manifests."
66,Mon Oct 19 14:44:46 +0000 2020,"@drewmckevitt @RTMannJr @LATech See my other tweets. Here, I'm not commenting on the content itself but rather the appropriateness of ""online rage mobs"" more generally (I was struck by the use of this particular term.)"
67,Mon Oct 19 14:43:10 +0000 2020,"@drewmckevitt @RTMannJr @LATech I'm trying to evaluate this situation as objectively as possible, thinking about how one's political beliefs influence how one reacts to ""online rage mobs"" depending on the content of the speech involved. Are ""online rage mobs"" sometimes good, depending on the content?"
68,Mon Oct 19 14:42:55 +0000 2020,@mattbailey @RTMannJr @LATech I suspect you're thinking of a case at ULM. But I also think you're mistaking a sincere reaction against explicitly racist speech with a coordinated campaign that deliberately misrepresents someone's words with the goal of getting them fired.
69,Mon Oct 19 14:40:47 +0000 2020,"@RTMannJr @LATech @drewmckevitt I wonder whether it is integrous for one to be okay with online rage mobs when said mobs' cause lines up with one's own. I'm reflecting on this for myself right now, given that a short time ago I joined in the social media advocacy after a LaTech instructor made racist remarks."
70,Mon Oct 19 14:39:22 +0000 2020,@mattbailey @RTMannJr @LATech Do you not think there is a substantive difference between political speech criticizing the president and explicitly racist speech?
71,Mon Oct 19 14:35:53 +0000 2020,"@RTMannJr @LATech @drewmckevitt Appropos of nothing, it is interesting to realize that this exact tweet could have been published by a right-wing activist in the wake of a faculty member being disciplined or fired for making racially-offensive statements."
72,Mon Oct 19 14:27:40 +0000 2020,@RTMannJr @drewmckevitt @LATech Check out @LDBurnett‚Äôs story.  Just appalling.  Admin are admin everywhere.
73,Mon Oct 19 14:26:51 +0000 2020,"@RTMannJr @LATech @drewmckevitt Funny just yesterday I read, ""For years, √©migr√©s from the former Soviet bloc have been telling Rod Dreher they see telltale signs of 'soft' totalitarianism cropping up in America."" So obviously the conservatives will start rallying around esteemed Prof. McKevitt!"
