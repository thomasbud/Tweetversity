116,Sat Oct 24 09:28:07 +0000 2020,"@UNC @UNCpublichealth @Baric_Lab CCP restricted Wuhan ppl to go to Beijing in Jan 2020. 
Why? Because China knew that CCP CoronaVirus was dangerous.  

CCP allowed Wuhan ppl to go to USA, Europe, etc in Jan 2020.  
Why?  Because China used CCP CoronaVirus as a bioweapon to attack the West.

425,Sat Oct 17 20:24:07 +0000 2020,@lamarrichards_ @Lorianderson40 @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran I see that now--this is why its important to get multiple perspectives
426,Sat Oct 17 20:24:05 +0000 2020,@Lorianderson40 @peiferlabunc @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran I love the full piece!! It was the fact that just those two images were posted with the caption of ‚ÄúHow it started vs How it‚Äôs going‚Äù
427,Sat Oct 17 20:22:15 +0000 2020,"@Lorianderson40 @peiferlabunc @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran It does, however, symbolize the fact that Carolina was ((literally)) built on the backs of Black people. So when you give us a pic of young black boy with a shovel and an older white woman standing over him...in BLACK AND WHITE...what should POC think??"
428,Sat Oct 17 20:21:58 +0000 2020,"@lamarrichards_ @Lorianderson40 @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran I had watched the entire video it was edited from first, which I thought was a good story about sending Davie Poplar seedlings around the states and didn't think enough about how these two images alone would appear.  What did the young man profiled think?"
429,Sat Oct 17 20:14:34 +0000 2020,"@Lorianderson40 @peiferlabunc @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran It‚Äôs culturally and racially insensitive. Hence, why they removed the post and later apologized. They shouldn‚Äôt have posted the first pic...not to mention they edited it to make the photo black and white."
430,Sat Oct 17 19:22:50 +0000 2020,"@lamarrichards_ @UNC @KevinGuskiewicz @jgcurran What they need to do:  Stop bending to the will of the racist BLM people. There was nothing offensive with the photo. I wasn‚Äôt aware that slavery existed in 1993?! Just don‚Äôt post photos with black people in them, they‚Äôll have nothing to complain about!"
431,Sat Oct 17 19:22:46 +0000 2020,RT @UNC: On Friday we posted a tweet that included an image from 1993 that evoked painful memories of racism and slavery. We have heard you‚Ä¶
